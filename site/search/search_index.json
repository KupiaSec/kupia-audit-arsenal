Main Points</p> <ul> <li>Reentrancy vulnerabilities are a serious threat to smart contracts.</li> <li>These vulnerabilities are relatively common, and often arise unexpectedly in audits.</li> <li>My guide covers multiple types and variations of reentrancy attacks.</li> <li>This video aims to distill the core knowledge of re-entrancy attacks.</li> <li>I'll present clear methodologies for uncovering re-entrancy vulnerabilities in smart contracts</li> </ul> <p>2. Key Insights</p> <p>This video isn't just about identifying reentrancy bugs; it's about understanding them.  My insights go beyond the superficial:  I'm not just describing what reentrancy is, but why it happens.</p> <ul> <li>The Heart of the Problem:  Reentrancy allows an attacker to unexpectedly call into a contract multiple times.  This is often due to a lack of validation within the code.  A key vulnerability lies within the system's expectation that a state variable will have been updated before calling the external function \u2013 a misunderstanding that allows attackers to manipulate the system.</li> <li>Variations and Complexity: Reentrancy isn't one single attack vector.  It can manifest in various forms, from straightforward to very complex interactions across multiple contracts.  Even with existing non-reentrant modifiers, unforeseen side effects are possible due to how external calls can interact.</li> <li>Preventive Measures:  A crucial insight is that re-entrancy problems aren't just about detecting the issue; they're about preventing it.  Robust coding practices, proper validation procedures, and proactive checking of state variables across external calls are essential.</li> <li>Why Smart Contract Security Matters: This isn't just an academic exercise. As a founder of Guardian Audits, I focus on preventing real-world attacks in deployed smart contracts.  The frequency at which these vulnerabilities still appear stresses the importance of continued research and robust auditing practices. This guide equips you with the knowledge needed to recognize and address reentrancy vulnerabilities in practical smart contract audits and implementations.</li> </ul> <p>3. Practical Takeaways</p> <ul> <li>Understand the flow:  Thoroughly examine the sequence of events in smart contract interactions. Pay specific attention to external calls during the workflow.</li> <li>Validate states: Never assume a state variable will have been updated. Implement explicit checks to ensure the correct state has been reached before making external calls. If state variables are not updated correctly, the attacker can exploit this.</li> <li>Defensive Coding: If possible, add defensive code around critical functions. I personally like to implement non-reentrant modifiers.</li> <li>Static Analysis Tools: Utilize tools like Slither to help automate the process of identifying common reentrancy patterns.</li> <li>Community Engagement: Join fellow smart contract auditors to gain insights and share experiences from real-world audits. This shared experience, knowledge and understanding of best practices is key to improving the security of smart contracts</li> </ul> <p>4. Additional Notes</p> <p>This video goes into immense detail, covering many different examples and scenarios.  My objective is to not just explain the what but to show how to apply this understanding in the practical context of smart contract auditing, including cross-contract interactions, read-only functions with implicit side effects and the interplay with other parts of the smart contract system.  The key to fixing these complex issues is rigorous design and a thorough understanding of how the code interacts with the state.</p>"},{"location":"audit/Web3%20Security%20101/20230514_Build%20Your%20Auditing%20Toolkit%20_%20Findings%20Breakdown/","title":"Build Your Auditing Toolkit","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20230514</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTt8PcZVwZI</p>"},{"location":"audit/Web3%20Security%20101/20230514_Build%20Your%20Auditing%20Toolkit%20_%20Findings%20Breakdown/#build-your-auditing-toolkit-findings-breakdown","title":"Build Your Auditing Toolkit | Findings Breakdown","text":"<p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>This video is a deep dive into analyzing audit reports.

The attacker is literally \"sandwishing\" the user's transaction between two of their own, exploiting the system's lack of real-time price synchronization. Another crucial insight is how carefully a system must be designed to handle high-volume or fast-moving transactions, especially the handling of slippage.  Ultimately, the exploit revolves around exploiting weaknesses in how the system handles these order books.  We need to understand that while exchanges exist to execute transactions, the complexity of multiple transactions crossing the order book can lead to exploits like Sandwich attacks.

Instead, it relies on integers and truncations.  This can cause issues when trying to represent a fraction, like (9/10).  Solidity truncates the result, meaning that it chops off the decimal portion of the outcome.   This truncation leads to a severe error when a number is not exactly divisible.

One key insight is that these stepwise jumps can create problems in the value, distribution of rewards, or other calculations over time.  Imagine a reward per share rate that changes subtly, but repeatedly, often unnoticed. At first, the impact might be negligible, but over many transactions, the cumulative effect can be a significant loss or an unexpected gain for certain (or malicious) users.  A malicious entity could manipulate the logic in subtle ways leading to unintended outcomes.  Many of these attacks are subtle. These flaws are often concealed within functions tied to reward distribution, staking, or unstaking. It's precisely because they're subtle, and their effects often compound over time, that they don't get discussed or flagged as often as more straightforward security risks.

Some of the most important aspects are:</p> <ul> <li>Stablecoins: Cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. They provide stability within the volatile crypto market and facilitate seamless transactions. Examples include DAI (an algorithmic stablecoin) and centralized stablecoins like USDC, USDT, and PAX. Centralized stablecoins involve a company holding the equivalent fiat currency, but a more trustless solution is the algorithmic stablecoin.</li> <li>Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): Platforms that enable users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other, without relying on a central authority. DEXs eliminate the need for intermediaries, promoting transparency and security.<ul> <li>Liquidity Pool Based DEXs: These platforms facilitate trades using liquidity pools, where users deposit tokens to create a pool of assets. Automated Market Makers (AMMs) determine the prices of assets based on the relative supply and demand within the pool. Prominent examples include Uniswap, Balancer, and Curve.</li> <li>Order Book Based DEXs: Function similarly to traditional exchanges, utilizing order books to match buyers and sellers. Prominent examples include IDEX.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Derivatives: Financial contracts whose value is derived from an underlying asset. Decentralized derivatives platforms offer new opportunities for trading and hedging risk. Synthetix is one of the most popular DeFi applications operating in this space.</li> <li>Lending and Borrowing: DeFi platforms facilitate peer-to-peer lending and borrowing, allowing users to earn interest on their assets or access capital without intermediaries. Compound is a notable example of a lending protocol. Compound is an algorithmic, autonomous interest rate protocol that allows users to supply assets (like ETH, USDC, DAI, or USDT) and earn interest. These supplied assets can be used as collateral for borrowing other assets.</li> <li>Margin Trading: Enables traders to amplify their positions by borrowing funds. dYdX and Fortube are examples of margin trading applications in the decentralized space. Margin trading, following traditional finance, is the practice of using borrowed funds to increase a position in a certain asset.</li> <li>Insurance: Decentralized insurance protocols, such as Nexus Mutual and Opyn, offer protection against risks like smart contract failures and deposit losses.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"defi/20200702_What%20is%20DEFI_%20Decentralized%20Finance%20Explained%20%28Ethereum%2C%20MakerDAO%2C%20Compound%2C%20Uniswap%2C%20Kyber%29/#defi-vs-cefi-a-comparison","title":"DeFi vs. CeFi: A Comparison","text":"<p>| Feature          | Decentralized Finance (DeFi)       | Centralized Finance (CeFi)             | | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | | Permissionless  | Open to anyone                    | Requires KYC/AML                      | | Open Source   | Encourages Collaboration         | Closed Source, Proprietary            | | Censorship Resistance | Cannot be Censored                    | Can be Censored                     | | Network Fees      | Cheaper, mostly                    | Expensive, due to intermediaries      |</p>"},{"location":"defi/20200702_What%20is%20DEFI_%20Decentralized%20Finance%20Explained%20%28Ethereum%2C%20MakerDAO%2C%20Compound%2C%20Uniswap%2C%20Kyber%29/#potential-risks-of-defi","title":"Potential Risks of DeFi","text":"<p>While DeFi presents a transformative vision for finance, it's essential to acknowledge the associated risks:</p> <ol> <li>Smart Contract Risks: Bugs or vulnerabilities in smart contracts can lead to financial losses.

Users deposit tokens (e.g., ETH, DAI, USDC, etc.) into a vault, and the vault's underlying strategy actively allocates those tokens to various yield-generating opportunities within DeFi.  This includes lending protocols (Aave, Compound), liquidity pools, and other yield farms.</p> <p>Here's a breakdown of the key steps:</p> <ol> <li>Deposit:  Users deposit their crypto assets (e.g., ETH) into a specific Yearn Vault.  Each vault is designed for a specific token. When a user deposits, they receive \"vault shares\" representing their proportional ownership within the vault.</li> <li>Strategy Execution: Each vault has an assigned \"strategy.\"  Strategies are also smart contracts which govern how the vault's assets are deployed within the broader DeFi landscape.  For example, a strategy might deploy deposited DAI to Compound, lend it out for interest, and then periodically harvest the COMP tokens earned as rewards. Then, it will convert the reward COMP token back to DAI and added it back to your principal increasing the overall value of deposited DAI which results in increased APY for users.</li> <li>Rebalancing: Strategies are not static. They continuously monitor the DeFi ecosystem for new and more profitable opportunities.  When a better opportunity arises, the strategy can rebalance by withdrawing assets from the current farm and depositing them into the new one.</li> <li>Compounding: Earned yield is regularly reinvested back into the vault, compounding users' earnings. After COMP rewards are auto-converted to DAI and compounded it back to principal DAI deposits.</li> <li>Profit Distribution and Share Value Increase: Profits generated by the strategy are used to increase the value of the vault's shares. When a user withdraws, they redeem their shares for a larger quantity of the underlying asset (e.g., more DAI) than they initially deposited thanks to the increased vault value which also proportionally increases the user's vault shares.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"defi/20200905_What%20are%20YEARN%20VAULTS_%20ETH%20Vault%20Explained%20_%20DEFI%2C%20YIELD%20FARMING/#technical-details-and-smart-contracts","title":"Technical Details and Smart Contracts","text":"<p>Yearn vaults rely heavily on smart contracts.

Their main benefit is fast transactions. Raiden Network (Ethereum) and Lightning Network (Bitcoin) are examples.<ul> <li>State Channels: This is the broad category of channels, encompassing various subtypes, including payment channels.</li> <li>Payment Channels: Focused specifically on payment transfers between participants.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Plasma: A framework for building scalable applications on Ethereum, using smart contracts and Merkle trees to create an unlimited number of \"child chains\" (copies of the parent Ethereum blockchain), offloading transactions from the main chain. Drawbacks include a long waiting period for users withdrawing funds, and not supporting general-purpose smart contracts which limits it to simple payments. OMG Network (Matic Network) is an implementation of Plasma.</li> <li>Sidechains: Ethereum-compatible, independent blockchains with their consensus models and block parameters. Interoperability with Ethereum made possible by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing contracts deployed to Ethereum to be directly deployed to the sidechain. xDAI is an example.</li> <li>Rollups: Provide scaling by bundling a number of sidechain transactions. Sidechain transactions are rolled up into the a single transaction with cryptographic proof (SNARKs which is Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge), submitting only that proof to base layer to save gas fees.<ul> <li>ZK-Rollups: Use zero-knowledge proofs (SNARKs) for faster and more efficient processing.</li> <li>Optimistic Rollups: Transactions are assumed to be valid unless challenged where fraud proofs are then executed.     There are two types of Rollups: ZK-Rollups, and Optimistic Rollups. ZK Rollups are faster and more efficient than Optimistic Rollups.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>ZK Rollups, although faster and more efficient than Optimistic Rollups, existing smart contracts cannot easily migrate to Layer-2. Optimistic Rollups run an EVM-compatible virtual machine called OVM (Optimistic Virtual Machine) which allows for executing the same contracts as can be executed on Ethereum. This offers composability. Optimism does this; for ZK-roll-ups, there is Loopring, Diversify, and ZK-Sync.</p> <p>Rollups can also be magnified by Ethereum 2.0, only needing the data layer to be scaled; and therefore, they can get a tremendous increase in performance.</p> <p>Rollups and Ethereum 2.0 seems like an integrated Layer-2 solution for the future, with Ethereum converging.

This provides a robust and secure foundation.  Here's a breakdown of the key components:</p> <ol> <li> <p>THORChain Blockchain:  This is a separate blockchain, not built on Ethereum. It has its own consensus and network layer, thanks to Tendermint and Cosmos SDK. This allows THORChain to operate independently and integrate with multiple blockchains.</p> </li> <li> <p>THORNodes: These are the validator nodes of the THORChain network. Each THORNode runs several critical services:</p> <ul> <li>THORChain Service:  This runs the THORChain blockchain itself (recording transactions, managing state, etc.).</li> <li>Full Node of Connected Chains:  Each THORNode runs a full node for each of the blockchains THORChain supports (e.g., a Bitcoin full node, an Ethereum full node, etc.).  This allows the nodes to directly observe transactions on those chains.</li> <li>Bifr\u00f6st Protocol: This is the \"connective layer\" that links the THORChain network to the external blockchains.  It's responsible for watching vault addresses, observing inbound transactions, converting them into \"witness\" transactions on the THORChain, and constructing/broadcasting outbound transactions.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Vaults: These are multi-signature addresses (or, more accurately, Threshold Signature Scheme addresses) on the external blockchains (e.g., a Bitcoin address controlled by the THORChain network).  There are two types:</p> <ul> <li>Inbound Vaults: These are the primary vaults that hold the majority of the funds.  They are more secure but slower, requiring a 2/3 majority of TSS signers to authorize a transaction (taking up to 20 seconds).</li> <li>Outbound Vaults:  These are smaller, less secure vaults run by each THORNode individually. Only a single signature from the node is required.  They hold a limited amount of funds (capped at 25% of the node's bond) to facilitate faster outbound transactions.  The funds in these vaults are constantly topped up from the inbound vaults.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS):  This is a crucial security mechanism.  Instead of storing private keys on individual nodes (which would be a massive security risk), THORChain uses TSS.  TSS is a cryptographic primitive for distributed key generation and signing.

Instead of renting liquidity; OlympusDAO aims to own it.</p> <p>Key Mechanisms of OlympusDAO:</p> <ul> <li>OHM Token: OHM is OlympusDAO's native token, designed not to be pegged to anything specific (like USD), but to act as a decentralized reserve asset.  The target price is backed by a basket of assets controlled by the DAO.</li> <li>Bonding: Olympus allows users to sell LP tokens (e.g., OHM-DAI) or other crypto assets (like DAI) to the protocol in exchange for discounted OHM tokens.  These OHM tokens are \"vested\" over a period, meaning they are released gradually over time.<ul> <li>Benefit to the Protocol: This allows Olympus to accumulate its own liquidity (LP tokens) and reserves (other crypto assets) directly. This PCV is then used to back the OHM token price.</li> <li>Benefit to Bonders:  Users get discounted OHM, essentially buying at a lower price than the market rate.  However, they have to wait for the vesting period to gradually claim their tokens.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Staking: OHM holders can stake their tokens on the OlympusDAO platform.  Staked OHM earns rebase rewards, which are newly minted OHM tokens distributed to stakers.  These rebase rewards are sourced from the revenue generated by the bonding process and PCV.</li> <li>Rebase Model: The rebase mechanism ensures that the circulating supply of OHM expands to meet the target APY for stakers. This is tied to the bonding revenue that the protocol earns. High bonding revenue leads to potentially higher rebase rewards.</li> <li>Governance:  OlympusDAO is governed by OHM token holders, who can vote on proposals regarding the protocol's parameters and strategic direction.</li> </ul> <p>Benefits of OlympusDAO's Model:</p> <ul> <li>Owned Liquidity:  The protocol controls its liquidity, making it less vulnerable to \"vampire attacks\" and external market forces.</li> <li>Reduced Reliance on Incentives:  Less reliance on constantly rewarding LPs with unsustainable APYs, leading to more stable tokenomics.</li> <li>Decentralized Reserve Currency:  Aims to create a decentralized reserve asset (OHM) for the DeFi ecosystem.</li> </ul> <p>Risks Associated with OlympusDAO:</p> <ul> <li>Ponzi Scheme Allegations:  The high APYs for staking OHM has raised concerns due to high volatility.

Major incidents, including those affecting Poly Network, Compound, Cream Finance, and BadgerDAO, resulted in billions of dollars in losses. The Wormhole hack alone led to a $320 million loss. Even established protocols weren't immune; a bug in SushiSwap, discovered by a white-hat hacker, could have caused a $350 million loss.  These events highlight the critical need for rigorous security audits and robust smart contract design.</p> </li> <li> <p>Regulatory Uncertainty:  Unclear and evolving regulations surrounding DeFi (and crypto in general) created significant uncertainty for users, investors, and founders.  Countries banning and unbanning crypto, and attempts to shoehorn DeFi into existing (and often ill-fitting) financial regulations, generated considerable headwind.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rise of \"Cult of Individuals\" and Questionable Practices: The speaker notes a concerning trend of excessive focus on personalities and \"cult of individuals\" within certain DeFi projects. This, coupled with instances of projects employing individuals with questionable pasts (e.g., convicted criminals working anonymously), raised ethical and security concerns.  The emphasis should be on the code and the community, not individuals.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ponzi-like Schemes and Forks:  The ease of deploying EVM-compatible chains led to a proliferation of forks of established DeFi protocols (like Uniswap, Aave, and Olympus).

Aave launched version 3, improving capital efficiency and risk management.  Bancor announced version 3, with reduced trading costs and impermanent loss protection.  Thorchain introduced synthetic assets.</p> </li> <li> <p>Layer 2 Scaling Progress: While delayed, Layer 2 scaling solutions are making progress.  Optimism and Arbitrum are improving their code, and Polygon has acquired multiple scaling solutions (including ZK-rollup tech like Hermez, Nightfall, and Miden). Starkware is developing StarkNet, a general-purpose ZK-rollup.</p> </li> <li> <p>Multi-Chain DeFi Expands: DeFi activity is rapidly growing on alternative blockchains like Avalanche, Fantom, Solana, and Terra.

It will dramatically reduce ETH issuance, potentially making ETH deflationary.  This is expected to occur between June and August (at the time of the video), but it is contingent on successful testing. The Merge is a primary driver of the current narrative around Ethereum and could trigger a bull market.</p> </li> <li> <p>Further Layer 2 Development:  Further improvements to Layer 2 scaling solutions (like EIP-4488, which reduces the gas cost of calldata) will make DeFi significantly cheaper and faster.  This will likely lead to greater adoption and enable the development of new DeFi protocols that were previously impossible to implement due to high gas costs. The full launch of StarkNet is particularly anticipated.</p> </li> <li> <p>Indexes Usage:     In traditional finance, indexes such as S&amp;P 500 and FTSE 100 have gone through a cycle of growth and have become a huge part of the overall market, which hasn't been implemented yet in Defi, that's why there will be a lot of focus on them, especially since the nature of smart contracts allows for easy creation of different indexes.</p> </li> <li> <p>DeFi as the Backbone of Web3:  DeFi could become the financial infrastructure for emerging ecosystems like NFTs, the metaverse, and DAOs.  This includes tokenizing NFTs, fractionalizing ownership, and enabling financial transactions within these spaces.</p> </li> <li> <p>Regulatory Clarity (Hopefully):  The speaker highlights the urgent need for clear and sensible regulations around DeFi and crypto taxation. Unclear rules stifle innovation and create an adversarial environment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Long-Term Shift to On-Chain Finance:  The long-term prediction is that most liquidity will eventually move on-chain, attracting banks, hedge funds, other financial companies, and even entire countries to DeFi.</p> </li> <li> <p>Chain Concentration:  While a long tail of blockchains with functioning DeFi ecosystems will exist, liquidity is expected to concentrate around a handful of major chains.</p> </li> </ul> <p>*During these difficult market situations, you have to be informed of the latest updates, to get the best profits when the market recovers.</p> <ul> <li>Price Resurgence:  While short-term price predictions are difficult, the speaker suggests a potential resurgence in DeFi token prices as the world recognizes the ongoing development and innovation within the space.</li> </ul> <p>In conclusion, DeFi has weathered significant storms, but the underlying technology and the drive for a more open, permissionless, and efficient financial system continue to propel its development.

It is about building relationships, questions, showing passion, and that you want to learn.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Part 4: The Competitive Cyber Security Job Market</p> <ul> <li> <p>A: There are many graduates and online course completers, but relatively few entry-level positions, making the initial job search very difficult, especially for those pivoting from other industries.</p> </li> <li> <p>A: A degree or certification is like a \"tick of confirmation,\" but conversations are as essential.</p> </li> <li> <p>A: In Australia, there are many events (conferences, networking nights).  LinkedIn is also crucial for reaching out.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: Confirmation from interviewer that many people end up having a radomn path to cybersecurity     A: \"Randomness factor\" is involved. You need to put yourself in positions to meet people.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: Confirmation.     A: University students often don't seek networking and that is why the majority doesn't secure a role after graduating. Start looking \"six months before\" finishing studies.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: How much is valuable a resume?     A: Only so much can be gleaned from a resume.  Familiar names (from networking) can make a difference.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: What matters other than technical skills?      A: Attitude, approach to learning, and communication skills are incredibly important, especially for GRC roles.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Part 5: Developing Soft Skills</p> <ul> <li> <p>Q: How can people develop those crucial soft skills?     A: \"Exposure therapy\" is key.  Get involved in community events, present at university, put yourself in uncomfortable situations to build confidence.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: Is it easier to develop soft skills online?     A: It's harder online.  \"Live exposure\" is essential for developing the ability to speak and connect with people.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: Confirmation that putting oneself out and being social are helpful.     A: Emphasizes the \"spectrum of people\" and the need for continuous self-improvement. No degree can substitute real practice.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Part 6: Career Progression and Leadership</p> <ul> <li> <p>Q: Jacob's recent promotion to management and how his day-to-day has changed.     A: The change is more in the \"way you operate.\" Still involved in leadership and mentorship. Now, also manages complex projects with many stakeholders.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: How did Jacob learn these leadership concepts?     A: He emphasizes learning on the job.  He mentions reading books (like \"Radical Candor\") and listening to podcasts, but stresses observational learning and having a good mentor.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: Advice for managing a team      A: Providing clear, concise and actionable feedback is essential.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Part 7: Degrees, Certifications, and Advice for Job Seekers</p> <ul> <li> <p>Q: Is it worthwhile, skill shortage exists, etc?      A: For young people (18) considering a cyber career, a degree is not absolutely required, but be prepared for dedicated self-study. For those already in other industries, self-study may be more practical.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: Is the Cybersecurity degree worth it?     A: A degree gives more networking opportunities, but at this point in Jacob's career, a Master's wouldn't be worthwhile</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: Advice if struggling to land an entry-level role.     A: Be reflective. Seek feedback from interviews, even before knowing the outcome.  Focus on communication and showing genuine interest.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: Is there a skills shortage?      A: Not a skills shortage, but an experience shortage. Companies want people with some experience, even for entry-level roles.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Part 8: GRC vs. Technical Roles</p> <ul> <li> <p>Q: Which path (technical vs. GRC) should someone choose?     A: It depends on the person's preferences.  GRC is \"business-oriented,\" focusing on risk management and compliance.  Technical roles are hands-on, but GRC roles can provide a broader understanding of the cybersecurity field.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: Confirmation from interviewer the GRC is more business oriented.      A: Says it maybe a bit easier to get into, but the skillset is different.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: Is it easy to switch between roles with some experience?      A: It's much easier to move from GRC to a technical role (or vice versa) after gaining some experience in any cyber security role.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Part 9: Personal Branding and Networking</p> <ul> <li>Q: The importance of a personal brand and networking.     A: It is important to building relationships.  There are \"internal\" and \"external\" brands.  Internal branding is about your reputation within your organization.</li> </ul> <p>Part 10: Jacob's Future Career Goals</p> <ul> <li>Q: Jacob's future career aims.     A:  He's currently studying for the OSCP. His long-term goal is to pivot into a more technical role, possibly in security engineering. He doesn't necessarily see a management-only path for himself.</li> </ul> <p>Part 11: Fun facts and conclusion chat</p> <ul> <li> <p>Q: The origins of cyber security.   A: Started playing RuneScape, in 2012 someone offered him money for gold in the game, then his first transaction got reversed. The game gave him insights into \"black hat community\", social engineering, and made him interested in the field.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: End of the interview, thanks Jacob by coming in   A: Jacob expresses he is happy to contribute.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Key Takeaways:</p> <ul> <li>Networking is Paramount:  Meeting people, building relationships, and getting your name known are absolutely essential for breaking into and advancing in cybersecurity.</li> <li>Soft Skills Matter:  Communication, attitude, and a genuine interest in learning are just as important as technical skills, especially for entry-level roles.</li> <li>Experience Over Credentials: While degrees and certifications can be helpful, practical experience (even self-taught) and the ability to demonstrate skills carry more weight.</li> <li>GRC is a Viable Path: Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) roles can be a good entry point, particularly for those with a business or communication-oriented background.</li> <li>Continuous Learning: The cybersecurity field is constantly evolving.  Commitment to ongoing learning and self-improvement is critical.</li> <li>Be Adaptable: Be open to different roles and paths within cybersecurity.  It's a broad field, and your interests and goals may change over time.</li> <li>Don't Be Afraid to Ask: Ask for feedback, seek out mentors, and don't be afraid to put yourself out there.</li> <li>Have Realistic Expectations: Entry-level roles are competitive. Be prepared for a potential pay cut if switching domains, and prioritize learning initially.</li> <li>Don't just be a tick box: In this industry many people have degrees or certifications, it does not really means anything. Making the difference by showing you know more and are passionate.</li> <li>Research the institutions: Study the different educational alternatives in detail. The name, the subjects and courses, the teachers, the resources.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"podcasts/Andy%20Li%20Podcast/20221112_%40JohnnyTime%20-%20Israel%20Defense%20Forces%2C%20Blockchain%2C%20DeFi%20and%20Life%20as%20a%20Web3%20Digital%20Nomad/","title":"@JohnnyTime - Israel Defense Forces, Blockchain, DeFi and Life as a Web3 Digital Nomad","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20221112</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCsfUrzrcgQ</p> <p>Here's a comprehensive summary of the YouTube video \"@JohnnyTime - Israel Defense Forces, Blockchain, DeFi and Life as a Web3 Digital Nomad,\" formatted in a Q&amp;A style and broken down by context.</p> <p>Introduction</p> <p>Q: What is the episode about?

A: Jackson says he's happy to be on the podcast.</p> <p>Jackson's Background</p> <p>Q: The Host asks Jackson about his background. A: Jackson worked at Amazon for five years. Now he does smart contract auditing at Spearbit and works on the Web3 wallet at Robinhood.</p> <p>Q: When did you start at Amazon? A: Around five years ago, near the height of the Ethereum ICO craze.</p> <p>Q: What were you thinking at the time? A: Jackson didn't want to work at Amazon forever. He wanted a consulting job allowing flexibility and higher pay.</p> <p>Q: What's your thought process after then? A: It seemed like machine learning and blockchain were nascent technologies emerging at the same time. He was more interested in cryptography and chose blockchain.</p> <p>Q: So, what did you do? A: Jackson read white papers, started blogging, and positioned himself as a thought leader in the blockchain space.</p> <p>Q: How was your consulting business back then? A: Early clients were token companies (Eveland and Lend Tokens and smaller ones) getting ready to launch tokens.</p> <p>Q: What did you take from that era? A: After being in crypto long enough, decentralization isn't that important, so Jackson pivoted toward the ER, space. Then, during DeFi summer he pivoted to security.</p> <p>Q: So, what has lead your to Smart Contract Security? A: High stock options made it difficult to leave Amazon. The crypto community resonated with him more. At some point, money becomes less important, and he wanted a community.</p> <p>Leaving Amazon, Finding Web3</p> <p>Q: At that time, did your manager know you' re leaving? A: His Amazon manager joked about him making a billion dollars in crypto.</p> <p>Q: So after deciding. You Just Left? A: More as gig, as in he had to leave the comfort Zone.</p> <p>Q: Can you say why is cryptocurrency so entertaining?

Started coding around 15 years old, always loved building stuff. Got into security by watching YouTube documentaries and experimenting with Kali Linux and Wireshark. Stumbled upon Solidity and found it similar to JavaScript, became interested and eventually discovered Web3 security was a good field.</li> </ul> <p>Journey into Solidity and Web3:</p> <ul> <li>Q: (Implied: What was the path you took to Web3?)</li> <li>A: In UK crypto started becoming popular. Started researching blockchain and crypto, then two and a half years ago at university, stumbled upon Solidity. Found similarities with JavaScript and salaries were better than Web2, motivated to go deep dive into the rabbit hole.</li> </ul> <p>Finding Opportunities and Mentorship</p> <ul> <li>Q: How have you found opportunities and guidance in a relatively new field.</li> <li>A: It started with freelancing and networking but CoVID made remote working popular. That motivated to deeper rabbit hole. I met you at university, and we have learned together, contributed to GitHub, freelanced. I attended the Chainlink hackathon where I became champion. Got an internship with Zach (a developer advocate at Chainlink) who mentored me for a year.</li> </ul> <p>Blockchain Security Society and Developer Advocacy Role:</p> <ul> <li>Q: Tell me about the blockchain security society at your university and your role as a developer advocate.</li> <li>A: We are the biggest blockchain society in the UK. In the advocacy I run smart contract and hackaton workshops for Chainlink. Sergey has retweeted and it was the first time we were at the eyes of Chainllink Uh employee.</li> </ul> <p>Code4rena and Auditing:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Q: Let's talk about auditing, can you give a brief introduction and how that works as well.</p> </li> <li> <p>A: We organized a free small contract workshop and then an in-person smart contract event that has been retweeted by even Chainlink CEO. We had free and one-week for small contracts for free and workshops all around contributing at GitHub also. After all that, started the path into auditing by doing the following, learn about chainlink, do freelancing, contribute at GitHub and after all those efforts try to take the next step.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Advice on Code4rena and Getting a Job:</p> <ul> <li>Q: Do you have any specific questions about code arena or how to get a job?</li> <li> <p>A: Focus on one particular bug type. Try out what companies were doing and focus. The key is do one great deep dive.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: Any other advice you can offer now in hindsight.</p> </li> <li>A: Keep going with that level since it will get you a great opportunity with a black hat mentality.</li> </ul> <p>Key Advice and Insights to share</p> <ul> <li>A: Just do solidity and JavaScript to have web free skills. You should focus on the hacker to get more opportunity than development because I feel like the black hats is always gonna find a easy opportunity for his malicious hacking,</li> <li>A: Do code arena or hackathon and keep learning then you are ready for a good opportunity especially the coding area is really important by.</li> <li>A: Get yourself in that career for white hacks.</li> <li>A: If you did the deep dive you probably going to network. Have as much videos because that is really important.</li> </ul> <p>Deeper Dive on Code4rena</p> <ul> <li> <p>Q: Could you talk a bit more about Code4rena and your experience participating? How easy is it to get started and what are your thoughts?</p> </li> <li> <p>A: It's not that hard we're just looking.</p> <p>We can find different bugs based on different countries and countries, find Linux and wire shark.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Tyreese\u2019s experience and advice *   A: Just research the blockchain, we can build university. Join the discord server. Do the largest free workshop online. Most of the time as Patrick Collins. *   A: Watch is the first in-prison and Patrick Collins does the brilliant workshops online. I watch of his lot of videos. I try to do one free of the contracts per week. Patrick did retweet me again.  *   A: I just to be the developer advocate after years. You will have opportunity. *   A: We can do for about and small contract workshop which is one of their time because most most of them are online you know. *  A: Also the salary is well as well. Was better than web2 and I got my yeah like this is really really like this is really great also when covert came and brought remote working was really pushed. *  A: When I started learning that but digital nomads and stuff stuff like that like it really motivated me to just go deeper down the rabbit hole. *   A: I started doing a lot of validity development. I fell in love with the lady because it's so similar to JavaScript. 1800 thoughts this is crazy. Uh additionally to that sort of salaries as well was better than web2.</p> <p>Tyreese and The Interviewer journey towards security</p> <ul> <li> <p>Q: What was about the two journeys so far before we go.</p> </li> <li> <p>A: You learn solidarity in middle of lock down You made Laurens. You were leaning and doing open source project on GitHub etc. And people needed about launchpad, ERC token, etc so it was like like really good money it was so I enjoy and I learn about it. Because from I knew and two was just like office work and it's kind of like backhand you and I didn't and she didn't see a lot of that's it</p> </li> </ul> <p>Advice on Code4rena cont.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Q: Any thoughts.</p> </li> <li> <p>A: So Sergey so are we doing it and uh it was pretty good for the first time and then um we started getting partnership and and really start to network with all different people and I joined a Chainlink hackathon.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Specific Advice on Code4rena and Securing a Job in Web3</p> <ul> <li> <p>Q: Specific advice, what can students do to better position themselves for the auditing</p> </li> <li> <p>A: Do everything on chain and the smart contract should have great advice of so much people were been able to eat so you know like for a lot of his ones are online if you have in person then that will be best. Like you know, so much people were saying and to eat so umm for all of his ones are online so.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Building and the Difference Between Solidity and JavaScript</p> <ul> <li> <p>Q: What made you feel in love with solidity and what would you say to get into</p> </li> <li> <p>A: Building was a lot of validity. There's probably a great Pathway so the gate for rules. This was about something that's similar but there's something building it and then you know if you just follow the code that comes to this crazy to get you you follow.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Further Explanation on How to Approach Code4rena</p> <ul> <li> <p>Q: Any other things to consider</p> </li> <li> <p>A: For me I was about python SQL all lot stuff and this was obvious I come to it. But that makes sense but its was easy I really just programming to so um um just really you are so many about the different countries and attack like a Linux completely fell really, I was not in the school at Education and I didn't really see as much opportunity thought there's just different kind in in good for bad for about four,I want to to a good opportunity that stuck.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Involvement and Further Recommendations</p> <ul> <li>Q: It started to become a thing, how did that involvement increase and any other things to talk about?</li> <li>A: I didn really see you and JavaScript and JavaScript on like actually when I was actually the job when he said and then um know that I got about that research much into then I went to what technology at the end of and building   Key Points</li> <li>There is not too much to talk about that</li> </ul> <p>You try to be and there were quite involved in the lot of them which much   Quick Introduction*</p> <ul> <li>A: We kind of off to be a similar you know, to get it from for for but and data that a lot of the a lot of you hello.</li> </ul> <p>Interview Journey</p> <ul> <li>A: I'm good, really talking about the cutting young uh do and a JavaScript so and to started um and when the said lockdown happened.</li> </ul> <p>Recommendations For Chainlink and Auditing and Coding *   A: In the chain like the best so you tell just got opportunity and the is that was we so like coding and that any the best way for you to got the great get on top all hackathons are.</p> <p>Chainlink Advocacy and Hackathon *   A: In advocacy is probably this the I and do the one.</p> <p>Interview Tip/Recruiter Message Review \\ *   A: What's up when in for recruiter for Black.</p> <p>General Advice</p> <p>Q: Do you have specific advice around arena</p> <ul> <li>A</li> </ul> <p>Career and Final Thoughts *  A1 We should do the audits are team we are to is that code if you try 34 is happening that happen.</p> <ul> <li>A2: There or any I'll just give me is to the in the UK so the that the because</li> </ul> <p>Q: Thanks that amazing to listen</p> <p>That should be a comprehensive and actionable summary of the interview.</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Andy%20Li%20Podcast/20221215_0xDjango%20-%20Code4rena%20and%20Immunefi%20Bounty%20Hunting/","title":"0xDjango - Code4rena and Immunefi Bounty Hunting","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20221215</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2BAgbn2Um8</p> <p>Okay, here's a comprehensive summary of the YouTube video transcript provided, formatted as requested.</p> <p>Summary of: \"0xDjango - Code4rena and Immunefi Bounty Hunting\"</p> <p>Introduction: The video begins with an interviewer introducing 0xDjango and acknowledging his impressive progress in bug bounty hunting. *   Q: Introduces 0xDjango. Mentions achieved 14th rank on Code4rena leaderboard and over 100k in rewards. Highlights this as amazing progress. *   A: Thanks the interviewer with praise.</p> <p>Background &amp; Entry into Web3 Security: This section covers 0xDjango's background and how he found himself in the web3 bug bounty scene. *   Q: Inquires about his technical background and how he entered the industry. *   A: States he has a data background, specifically in database design, data warehousing, and business intelligence. He worked as a consultant on BI software, which gave him an \"attacker mindset.\"</p> <p>Learning Solidity and Approaching Audits: Discusses 0xDjango's method of learning Solidity and how he approaches audits and bug hunting. *   Q: Ask how he learned solidity so quickly given lack of coding background. *   A: He didn't initially know Solidity very well. He started by looking for attack paths on C4 without much Solidity knowledge, and it was an interesting challenge and good initial approach.</p> <p>Learning Resources and Methodology: 0xDjango elaborates on the learning resources that were helpful and how his auditing methodology has evolved. *   Q: Asks about what are sort of the other learning resources that use you would say helped you out the most just getting started. *   A: He started with YouTube, specifically \"Smart Contract Programmer\". However, a lot of nuances he didn't know was referenced in sleepy's Master list. States Mastering Ethereum book is helpful as well as interactive material specifically crypto zombies.</p> <p>He initially used a hybrid approach, looking for quick findings first before delving into a deeper understanding. He would also step back and read through past audit reports.</p> <p>Shifting to, and Strategies for, Immunefi: The conversation shifts toward Immunefi and the differences between bug hunting on Immunefi vs. Code4rena.</p> <ul> <li>Q: Did you do these steps (of learning/applying) before even joining C4 or you just started like when you joined C4 and started submitting?</li> <li>A: States, he did audit few but would just go through the code before hand. Then he actively submitted during the third or forth contest.</li> <li>A: Then after Code Arena came on board it was actually more profitable for that time because most projects had a large TVL which provided much larger payouts. Since around August and September, it has turned the switch and I more heavily focused on munify</li> </ul> <p>States the importance and use of input spoofing techniques</p> <p>Successful Finding vs project Acceptance: Discussions arise in the difficulties of gaining accepted submissions. *   Q: Asked: I believe they have such amount amount set of stories around. In that um yeah, kind of Without going details a general idea how did that. What is the story? Like is it without knowing solidity can do *   A: without going into specific organization- There are cases for Exploits of reserves.

But you kind of have a journey because it was really challenging. So I started just make a lot of content.</p> <p>Importance of Finance Fundamentals *   A: Finance concepts are important to getting a job in the space.</p> <p>Dev vs Auditing Mindset (7:26 - 8:18) *   A: Don't overthink the finance stuff and get intimidated, its another thing to usually pissed me up about the finance industry. *   A: So, yeah getting to have that baseline knowledge, help getting into smart controls, use the style concert that you're making in there.</p> <p>Best Use Case (8:18 - 8:27) *   Q: Getting back to the auditing and finding ways to move forward *   A: That is probably never be hacked.</p> <p>Immutability in Smart Contracts (8:27 - 9:17) *   Q: But how then do you that's why is a little disappointing to see you want them more products to help normal people, do you think that previous experience sort of help. you learn a lot of the concept. *    A: What even get more financial concepts, because I've sort of trouble learning the finance side, the York experience, really helpful, recommend people, that be you first step that fantastic book. Absolute Answer to build with more people helping build with is.</p> <p>Chainlink Scaling and Smart Contract Discovery (8:27 - 9:39) *   A: Learning and onboard team and I saw they were like, hey, do you want to put data that's really stupid, when he was doing data provider with you're gonna need to help bringing new data in chainlink. *  Q: Do you use Chainlink after that? *   A: Yeah I learned about Chainlink before I started using other resources.</p> <p>Learning DeFi Concepts and Finance Basics (9:39 - 10:01) *  A: Learning the best practice of the personal finance world. Get the Baseline, then jump after, then realized what you need help people. I'm the one to build yeah did that previous experience of help finance can get that that they were definitely to. Finance concepts very important yeah they're really important for learning defying all this</p> <p>.Chainlink Role &amp; Developer Advocacy (10:01 - 10:33)</p> <p>A great help learning dfy. Well to replace traditional finance system. Help the developer be the supreme coder of it. Q; did you worked at chainlink labs yeah? Years that right? And what did do at chainlink? A: About \u2154 year yes labs well, this is not that's absolutely and be an expert in a domain and have engineer learn I divide developing engineers pillar</p> <p>Three pillars of the Developer Advocate role: Use and Love, Teach People, Understand Chainlink. A key aspect was to have engineers learn about Chainlink.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Backgrounds and Building Products (10:33 - 11:01)  A: I am also build educational content it was like an excuse more educational content which is really cool people would ask I making is it part of your job? Like I had have YouTube channels so I can use in block in you know.</p> </li> <li> <p>A Youtube Content &amp; Industry Impression (11:01 - 11:29)</p> <p>My personal channel is mine its not for the company but help. It's been blast the space so I could really previous experience</p> </li> </ul> <p>How does did financial sort of help you a lot of learning.</p> <ul> <li>Security and Auditing (11:30 - 12:07) Cybersecurity is difficult so did have used all financial concept. Have the lens that helped you so people the process</li> </ul> <p>Auditing in Blockchain what has been the learning curve into learning that.</p> <p>**.Immutable Nature of Smart Contacts and Building  *  A:  that was really Cool the next note will always I thought it what really and just.</p> <ul> <li>Dev vs Auditing Mindset (12:07 - 12:42) Absolutely it helping to just don't what would do recommend people when they first in like I think</li> </ul> <p>Absolutely incredible That's the making.</p> <p>Understanding Finance Terms</p> <p>You will want to learn I feel you</p> <ul> <li>Finding The Learning Resources on Defy for Developers(12:47 - 13:30) </li> </ul> <p>Financial concert and for for you, but we need to and then do that previous expe * **What does financial instruments help.</p> <p>Chainlink Journey and Web 3 (13:30 - 14:20)** * Absolutely I went to make data that smart, you just fall out of Love thing that</p> <p>Impact of Bear Market *Q: Did that Previous experience.

A: Glad to be here!</p> <p>Q: Start from background A: I would say I got interested a bit in crypto in high school. Then went to university studying engineering but then switched over to computer science.</p> <p>Q: Recommend people to UNI these days and your graduation from UNI A: It depends on the country you are in, but Unis these days are insanely high cost and often not teaching the skills needed for work. Foundations are always useful.</p> <p>Q: Did you work for Sigma Prime during UNI and also paradigms etc? A: Joined Sigma Prime at the start of 2020, working part-time and finishing studies, fully auditing in May 2021.</p> <p>Kodorino and Working on Code Arena</p> <p>Q: I see you did a Kodorino thing and that you started doing a bunch of Codeo Arena A: I started doing a bunch of Code Area because we were in lockdown! How fast can I find issues became more the game.</p> <p>Experience at Spearbit</p> <p>Q: What is it like doing auditing at Sigma Prime? Do two Code Bases going at once make that hard? A: Two code bases can be hard.</p> <p>Q: How did you overcome the focus/concentration issues on many code bases and what was the difference being Kodorino and Sigma Prime (Spearbit)? A: Two different things, with Kodorino it was a bit of a game, how fast can I find issues? Sigma Prime I felt I had more time to really dive in into things more. Each were beneficial.</p> <p>Q: What do you optimize for now (high low medium severity)? A: Used to only go for finding the unique findings, high hanging fruit. But now trying to look for highs / mediums, because they obviously can spend more time and dig into that.</p> <p>Q: What percentage of time do you spend on Kodorino code arena? A: Maybe 5-15 hours. I find it hard to find the high severity stuff because there is more competition. I saved al ot of time up by not trying to find any little small issues.</p> <p>Importance of Math and Understanding Code</p> <p>Q: What should be people studying in school these, days, Computer Science, Maths etc? A: Probably math. I think that's really good.</p> <p>Q: But there's definitely an advantage when it comes to auditing and the ZK coding and mass intensive things that you need math for? A: Yeah, definitely. If you have math background you would have an area that you are very strong at. Lots of DEFIs are math heavy.</p> <p>Q: Understand what they're implementing goes a long way. After Uni getting an internal ship with Sifma Prime A: Yep, it definitely is like a different type of understanding, not rally just to break not rally really to understand properly</p> <p>Workflow as Lead Auditor</p> <p>Q: Now that you're a lead, do you handle multiple code bases? A: No, I cant really handle that right now.</p> <p>Q: How do you deal with switching code bases? A: I think I just treated them differently, Code Area at the time was more of how fast can understand them. Prime time: dive right into them</p> <p>Q: What has helped your auditing experience?  A: Having workshops, helps for mentoring people. You never get a senior position by grinding on your own. What was helpful was that Spirit was to find LBRs also.</p> <p>You can't really find a mentor ship if people distrust you It would also be helpful to find all of these gemini type traits early on in your career to progress. If someone could speed up that process that\u2019d be it</p> <p>How Long Each Stage Takes This section goes into the overall timeline from finding a bug and submitting report</p> <p>Newbies entering the space</p> <p>Q: What are your quick tips for newbies? A: Find people to work with. If you have people around that can be very beneficial Too many people want to work by themselves to increase the team and skill level.</p> <p>Q: What's your advice if you were starting now? A: To be honest I would probably just major in maths.. Math and physics is an exciting good foundation. It's all like math heavy so yeah it's definitely an advantage.</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Andy%20Li%20Podcast/20230328_Zach%20Obront_%20Winning%20Audit%20Contests%20%26%20Crushing%20Bug%20Bounties/","title":"Zach Obront: Winning Audit Contests &amp; Crushing Bug Bounties","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20230328</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57V-57ZXmfA</p> <p>Okay, here's a comprehensive summary of the YouTube video \"Zach Obront: Winning Audit Contests &amp; Crushing Bug Bounties,\" formatted as requested.</p> <p>Part 1: Background and Transition</p> <p>Q: Can tell us about your background, your experience with Code Arena? A:  Zach initially \"sucked\" at Code Arena but improved quickly. He transitioned from a business background, running a publishing company, to a more technical focus.     *   He focused on growing the publishing company, leading the team, working with authors, and handling marketing.     *   He hired a CEO to manage day-to-day operations, allowing him and his co-founder to explore different roles.</p> <p>Q: How did you transition from a business background into a technical one? A: He eventually decided it was time to explore the technical side, focusing initially on large language models and AI</p> <p>Part 2: Diving into Crypto Security</p> <p>A: Zach took a year off to study AI and Crypto full-time. After AI he transitioned to crypto security and Solidity learned more about blockchain vulnerabilities</p> <p>A: He found AI work less appealing and Crypto more interesting due to the community, the abundance of self-teaching resources, and the immediate opportunities available.</p> <p>A: He discovered Solidity after two days of learning it he got hooked in blockchain</p> <p>Part 3: Learning and Collaboration</p> <p>A: He emphasizes the importance of self-teaching and finding a community. He joined the Solidity Guild founded by Zach.</p> <p>A: He worked closely with another auditor, Throttled, he says the fastest learninf period   Q: How Does collaboration work you and Throttled and codorino  A: Mostly Discord Chat A: The collaboration led to significant earnings within a few months through audit contests</p> <p>Part 4: The Audit Process and Lessons Learned A: Before started learning bad points, in this cases there are some philosophy in learnig to start other company. A: The most efficient way is collab with throttle and with these process was fastest learning period A: But he also talked with other auditor</p> <p>Q: Talk about your auditing process.</p> <p>A: His process involves:  1. Going through the code from top to bottom to understand it and tagging anything that feels off.  2. Writing questions down if something is not right.</p> <ol> <li>Reviewing tutorial and stuff that can check some type to the code</li> <li>Checking every part</li> </ol> <p>A: He notes difficulty staying focused while auditing with young children at home.   * If not well you should go that route</p> <p>A: Documenting the ideas and questions.</p> <p>A: After an initial pass, he reviews the document created to try to generate more ideas.</p> <p>A: He prefers to find an excuse first, after the fact that's his point In all that there are some points and focus</p> <p>A: One approach to reverse engineer how they worked when they've previously found issues A: Make research in a development thing</p> <p>A: This process help for finding things he never had in mind before</p> <p>Part 5: The Role of Teams and Incentives in Auditing A: He says is very impactful learn from other members A: I don't think to all people that people be self-teaching, and coming together in every Space A: He said it helps all people from something interesting in some process about learning A: To have those connections when doing experiments</p> <p>A: Is to take thing serious</p> <p>A: He likes to work with others</p> <p>A: What do this look like He tells to do the best, no technical background Read stuff online, watch tutorials Just by yourself, and how will go about for learning</p> <p>A: He describes the incentives structure on Sherlock, where points are redistributed among participants. This means auditors with higher rankings have more to lose, which encourages more diligent work A: Just for experimentation</p> <p>A: He said that create a Discord server for all communication, and then every idea within the contest they will start a new channel. A: Some people has problems for that approach For what I think the best is just find the best way do in the team</p> <p>Part 6: The Immunefi Experience A: Top 10 Protocol A: As Research and Development Thing in Scribe</p> <p>A: Is like not get A PhD, there something other point into the code Not Only Technical Staff, only see that.</p> <p>A: What you didn't have the is that technical, self background You just have to read that part online</p> <p>A: Is not only to go for work specific But, if you wanna Learn and used it for one scope application</p> <p>A: I liked loved the implications of that and found the work kind of boring and so I thought maybe I, find the right ares. Started Learninig Solidarity and in 2 days I was like never mind, so sucked to blockchain</p> <p>A: In late 2021 he had the philosophy of trying to learn to start a company So do it under the samr umbrella scribe</p> <p>A:I actually have no interest to start another company, Like what am I doing I have so much fun technical stuff, why am I getting sucked back in it. A: But still had the philosophy</p> <p>A: Like if I am going to learn this, so that to can start a company Planning with some stuff and basic concepts but this basic help them tokenize the revenue</p> <p>A: A creative product would, be make &amp; sell to them fans in advance So is like Kickstarter style team and launch and help them making successful.</p> <p>Part 7: Advice and Key Takeaways A: In general, the best advice is join small-medium community A: The crypto space everything is skill-dependent</p> <p>A: He loves to share stuff A: Need one - one connections with people where you will can contact them and each others A: Try to work with someone and taking to the seriously because makes you can download the brand and mesh together.</p> <p>A: Working with someone that are really Sirius can improve your experience and make this funnier</p> <p>A: Have clear in mind that things can depend your Skill-level</p> <p>A: Security staff seems interesting, really take that seriously when you approach you will gain benefit on this, with the knowledge you gain.</p> <p>A: After learning this, try to as \"what am I doing\" with some technical part And keep have more and more fun technical staff in life why I Getting Suck in it. A: So there's a community and with this you can stay motivated and learn everything. Was super Impact and for many like he was on a super Twitter active.</p> <p>A: You don't be depend what I think</p> <p>A: How the brain works by the other people like I see that kid of thinking, like something they pay attention on that to like extremely variables values so, for me let's Go off to see what should I do</p> <p>A: Is in late definitely feels that crypto Space and everything is your skills</p> <p>A: So, I am here of share to what can I to share</p> <p>A: How you went to seem about learning? Umm yeah and that it, honestly one of things best in crypto</p> <p>A: It was that felt swimming upstream a lot time good education but community, do important, you couldn't do anything important the path.</p> <p>You that seems of have been actually have had some time, messing seeing Things went.</p> <p>A: The only the only way you improve is the framework your approach and like I will, see the details of your</p> <p>I have one that that help me feel so that's you</p> <p>And in particular. How that's I'll tell you you don't Yeah and it has with things that in the audit side And the speed of my brain you find. You will find something that are good Then you start</p> <p>A: \"It looks really cool, like you're in your team there's and what did community and learning resources. This video specifically to learn the blockchain and in that was late late year for like learn, things for start a company A: And I had like you know something you need take to exploring to build show up\"   *   Find a small group or community to connect with other people.</p> <p>A: What a big part of that I learned I love to start things 30 to leading the is not totally my vibe. A: I am take year off gonna do that &amp; spend half the year on language models which now so AI and the second half in Crypto so. Half part and like Python and basically of like basics of any tech stuff.</p> <p>A: How to Transition to business Background I guess yeah I had of it and I can start something company ideally related to publishing under and though we think that was had or the part as scribe you split off, your own thing What's is for self-learning? The more, and more do development what kind of everything learn to what and use yourself yeah, yeah I like it's and stuff best. There</p> <p>A: So that research and development thing in my part I split did is just self background.</p> <p>Important Advice For Improve Skills At Winning Code Contests: 1: Look with the community &amp; Learning Recourses! 2: There were no other ways when your the one is making sure code is to do and be careful with some. 3: You got to take that to do so great, to is awesome yeah I mean all sort! 4: I make that process I to the do that The the way and and I definitely too</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Andy%20Li%20Podcast/20230417_Web3%20Security%20Hangout_%20Hake%2C%20Pashov%20%26%20Andy/","title":"Web3 Security Hangout: Hake, Pashov &amp; Andy","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20230417</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1r6ZRnTAWE</p> <p>Here's a summarization of the YouTube transcript provided, following an interview format and focusing on the core information from the questions and answers.</p> <p>Web3 Security Hangout: Hake, Pashov &amp; Andy - Summary</p> <p>Part 1: Audit Company Structure</p> <p>Q: How do auditing groups in Web3 have a formal work setup or process? A: At Sigma Prime, they focus on writing Proofs of Concept (PoCs). The audit is divided into two parts: a comparable part to other firms, and a secondary part where they implement extra test and write PoCs</p> <p>Q:Is auditing touching one or up to four auditors? A: For Sigma Prime, it involves multiple auditors working as a team bouncing ideas with each other before additional tasks</p> <p>Part 2: Spearbit Auditing Process and Report Format</p> <p>Q: Can you share how Sparebit(auditing form), conducts the auditing process. what their auditing report looks like, and how collaborative the report process is? A: Spearbit's auditing process in GitHub involves code changes within a pull request. Anyone can immediately comment on the pull request The entire code is present via pull requests in GitHub, so whoever identifies an issue promptly comments on it stating the specific problem with suggested solutions (the changes, all the code is revieweable in github). It's collaborative, but speed is important because it can be efficient, so the first one finding the most finding the most issues usually 'wins The auditor finding the most issues does not matter in the end because its team work They have a tool that will generate automatically a report showing the issues within GitHub itself(from those pull requests)</p> <p>Part 3: Public vs. Private Audits and Scaling Audits</p> <p>Q: What are your opinions on private audit to public audits? A: Right now, for private audits, Andy clones code locally vs code on chain. Private pull requests formality can hinder back and forth communication, and collaboration to find solutions</p> <p>Q: (What about) setting up a structure for private audits? A: Hake does everything manually, is a solepreneur and has an overhead process so he is focusing on auditing from the command line instead</p> <p>Q: How does one scale their solo auditing firm and how do you include security researchers in your audits; and pay a share of awards to QA work? A: He has been doing audits with some real life (web3 friends). Andy has a model where his friends do the auditing alongside him and \"find duplicates\". He still pays them the reward of the code4rena reward pot for these audits</p> <p>Q: What are 2023 goals for your Web3 Security audit company? A: My point of view is from what I am getting lately because right now I am not actively approaching protocols so i can only show you from my perspective that they are getting too small-budget clients mostly. Right now the landscape is that while it is passion there are less audits. NFT budget is increasing so that's a trend\"</p> <p>Part 4: Projects, Standout Audits, Top Vulnerabilities:</p> <p>Q: Can you talk about the types of audits you've been doing? A: Most recent audit was dealing with NFT games using Layer0 Finding NFT vulnerabilities can be easier because general audiences want to have fun It has been harder to \"rug people\" - or do economical stuff due to the \"private key issues\", with the D5 protocols</p> <p>Q: What to do from a developer standpoint, to improve a code base, specifically in web 3.0? A: Validate Chainlink Oracle inputs from attacks such as high severity. Always have a low budget plan and implement it.. There is a lower budget for projects run by solepreneurs, use automated services to get started quickly</p> <p>Part 5: Team Auditing Benefits and Collaboration</p> <p>Q: Do you think there's benefit from that compounding fact of of just auditing with other auditing goups, just being able to bounce ideas off? A: The main benefit of team audits is the power of confirmation of findings instead of making the report just after fully fleshing out a vulnerability. Pull-requests have their benefit in making all members to see it, and also the protocol gets \"free value\"</p> <p>Part 6: Tooling and the future of remote collaboration in web3 security</p> <p>Q: Is everyone doing this type of github collaboration setup? In particular, how about making it all on chain? A: At sparebit it starts manually but everything from report generation is automated as much as possible</p> <p>Part 7: Code Arena / Code4Rena and the future of private Security Research</p> <p>Q: Do you feel that the current model of doing code4rena are working good enough or the model needs an update? Also a question about the legal side if you can share an opinion A: Yes all good except with time you get too much exposure to the code and there can come times that one might see a new exploit because of prior knowledge \"I hope to start something similar but for private audits\" - he's personally done C4 but not solo</p> <p>Part 8: Advice for New Auditors, Important Areas, Future Trends:</p> <p>Q: Any advice for new auditors? A: Yeah be methodical create a check list and make sure USDT and USDC tokens with multiple implementations on all implementations are tracked</p> <p>Q: About this final part (of the stream), do you have in mind what should this contain from the technical aspect and what do people want to know? A: A private key compromise is probably has been the biggest one in the past. so you can add security, and even all these things you can do to try to get your staff sorted\" -</p> <p>With so many chain links available to take away smoking signals that was kind of our biggest things that that were helpful and useful.</p> <p>Q: Final comments? A: \"\"we kind of get into the details well the whole year will be web.3 there still provide it we started really well\" it has become a very complex D5 logic\" --  - \"so all of the best there are so many protocols is it important I know a lot of people that is what's important to me this collaborative mean\"  - well the end product what's what's important -- It will be automatic report. This will give 4x. I feel Like in that report from GitHub is very nice there is some good points. It has been just to the Sigma All right so I do think that if there are all these changes and codes. so let's go\"</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Andy%20Li%20Podcast/20230523_Moise_%20Transitioning%20from%20Big4%20to%20Web3%20Security/","title":"Moise: Transitioning from Big4 to Web3 Security","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20230523</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=157FkhV3YdQ</p> <p>Okay, here is a comprehensive summary of the Youtube video \"Moise: Transitioning from Big4 to Web3 Security\", divided into parts based on the interview flow:</p> <p>Part 1: Background and Introduction to Tech</p> <p>Q: Background and upbringing. A: Son of Rwandan immigrants moved to America in early \u201890s; dad involved in tech from Agriculture study at U of M. Intro to computer through love of music; using family computer in high school torrenting music and softwares.</p> <p>Q: Discovering \u201cTech is cool\u201d through his father\u2019s work A: Watching father working in firewalls and security. Remembered watching him studying for CISSP and other security certifications. Watching him working on network security including servers and routers.</p> <p>Part 2: College, Finance, and Initial Career Path</p> <p>Q: Choosing Finance instead of Computers in college. A: Good with numbers and English lead to study Finance instead of Computer Science or music. Primary focus for financial banking.</p> <p>Q: Pivoting away from investment banking A: Decided against banking due to work-life balance concerns and interned at Federal Reserve, Minneapolis - found doing digital transformation of meeting memos from 1950s and 1960s. It was stepping stone into my full time career.</p> <p>Part 3: Big4 Experience - KPMG and Transition to Web3 Security</p> <p>Q: Gaining experience at KPMG from Finance A: Two internships in tax related advisory then full time after college in SAP GRC (Governance Risk Compliance); SAP is widely used to business process system for fortune 500. Working on audits and understanding client's systems and industry. He was on it for four years then transitioning into Crypto assets team helping understand crypto ecosystem.</p> <p>Q: Discovering web3 Security A: Stumbled upon a YouTube thumbnail about \"Web3 Security\" from an ETH Denver meetup. Interviewer Spencer was giving a presentation to Spearbit which was starting point in web3.</p> <p>Part 4: Transition skills from Big4 into web3 Q: What skills from that transferred? A: Attention to detail.</p> <p>Q: Importance of making client subject of expertise. A: Need to understand industry to make it into technology. In that sense, you can understand it better and make a subject an expertise.</p> <p>Q: Scoping and Reporting skills that transition to web3 Security. A: You need to be the SME (Subject Matter Expert), for auditors, it is control testing.</p> <p>Part 5: Advice for Transitioning to Web3 Security from Big4 and More General Advice</p> <p>Q: A piece of advice? A: Maintain hobbies and passion outside of the work so you find a nice place to balance out in your work.</p> <p>Q: What were those big books and stacks of cybersecurity book? A: \"We're still in the first inning\" in baseball terms.</p> <p>Q: Getting initial footing into space. A: Follow \"gold\" from Twitter. That\u2019s his way of filtering and seeing who else new stuff follows. 1. Finding top people in space 2. Helpin gin core coordination - meeting coordination get introduced through open-eyes</p> <p>Q: Advice in general A: A lot of great skills from previous roles can apply to anything. But the key is finding your role that are valuable out in open. It's important for newcomers to be open to a lot of things and be vigilant. </p> <p>Q: What can prevent from moving A: Biggest thing is having this mindset of being safe. Be able to be transparent and don\u2019t rugpull people.</p> <p>Q: Top learning resources in the space (Discord Chanels or others) A: Join Discord servers! Hop on the Twitter page. You can go to those people and get familiar to everyone.  * Securium * Spearbit</p> <p>This should summarize the interview accurately and comprehensively, following the flow of the conversation and extracting the key information.

A: At Amazon, Joe worked in the central appsec team, auditing code for various teams. At Apple, he was embedded on a specific team and audited the majority of their code, thinking about potential security threats.</p> <p>Part 2: Threat Modeling and Operational Security</p> <p>Q: Talk to me a bit about Threat Modeling. A: Joe believes security engineering is essentially threat modeling, going beyond application security and considering operational security. He emphasizes thinking about crazy scenarios and who has access to what, as well as how many people it would take to materialize an insider threat.</p> <p>Q: Do you have an example? A: An example of crazy thinking could be \u201cwhat if aliens repel into the data center?\u201d and other weird inputs. The main purpose of threat modeling isn\u2019t that however, he found that their infrastructure engineers had far too much permissions, that's when one find some value if you do it right.</p> <p>Q: What value did they added? A: Actually found out that all of the assumption they had about hot to fix that where actually untrue.</p> <p>Part 3: Web3 Security and its Unique Challenges</p> <p>Q: Web3 is booming. Can you share how Security is there? A: It's interesting that we focus too much on the smart contract side. So you need to look for the holistic operational security uh Right, like who have the keys all access to everything what combination of people does it take to materialize and insider that can just kind of walk away with some sensitive information like when you have time at your disposal you can start thinking of these crazy scenarios and actually some of them have some value you know infrastructure engineers that had way too much permissions.</p> <p>Q: Tell me more of the Road and Bridge hacking and opsec.  A: That's an example of how keys when properly protected was kind of an infrastructure failure, someone hadn't really put enough thought into what happens in these scenarios is that defense in depth there in place.</p> <p>Q: The opsec security are violated, right? Traditional opsec? A: Yes, it was not protected so assumptions not true.</p> <p>Q: What is the focus we have in Web3. A: I think we tend to focus in web3 in the application security, and that can really get you into trouble because most projects have some sort of kind of permission system where like they own the proxy contract there you know is like a small Quorum of people that update the contracts and they just push through versel or posted on AWS.</p> <p>Q: Are all doing right? A: Not really knowing what you're doing in terms of security compromise and entirety of the your project just speaking of front end and not so sure if you saw this but just literally 30 minutes before we jumped on Loadbalancer put out on tweet to don't interact it because our front end is getting attacked with it yeah it's pretty crazy.</p> <p>Part 4: The divide in security and industry shift</p> <p>Q: Is AppSec enought for web3. A: No! in web3 is 90% Appsec it's all application security but there are lots that was forgotten like private keys compromise and infrastructure</p> <p>Q: Is enough people are in the infracstructure area. A; In the Web 3? No.</p> <p>Q: Freelancing and Web 3? A: Before starting doing what I'm on now I wanted to break the 3 space as a Auditor and I was on a Freelance working, while I was learning this uh smart contract after of things so I could go from Web 2 into Web 3. My operational security knowledge was not that diferent between the both.</p> <p>Part 5: The Audit, security tools and AI</p> <p>Q: From the current tools right now, what are you finding. A: The main issue in Audits is writing reports, the craziest of of then a core what happens and I actually some value like found that I think we found you know infrastructure engineers that have way too much permissions.</p> <p>Q: The tool are not what it needs to be, Right? What tooling did you have at apple and amazon and what's still not available here/ A: I'm using so.Yeah! The biggest thing that people would be surprised about when you kind of peak under the hood at not just people tend to focus in in the web free application security. Web 2 got Network Physical operational and appsec are a lot less you to focus web free space but I just on the application security and that can really get you in trouble. It's also what I saw kind free companies like the tooling is is there is no one really takes the time to secure their cloud infrastructure and that can happen. So it is that there a defense in depth in place. So, but again it depend the case. What will we do with AI? You can't get from that</p> <p>Part 6: Auto Wizard and wrap up: The Future and Conclusion</p> <p>Q: You will start you're oqn security company, what value Auto Wizard will offer?</p> <p>A: I'm Automative that is is no not just web free free companies, but companies in general that no one really takes the time to secure their their their Cloud infrastructure because well like the future is going to be more tools and that should probably Network security infrastructure security physical security uh operational and AppSec and and these things kind of get more or less equal attention and and that's is when things tend to happens so so yeah so I think people tend that had access to the front end so it was like a contract or something just added some code. So and then speaking and front end interface it's right and that's they easy like you spend all our time focusing on the smart contracts security side but they're just want aspect whole ecosystem like in uh in the figure space I feel like we've gotten a little lopsided uh when you think about like Web 2 you've got uh network security infrastructure physical security operational security and appsec so um before I started what I'm doing now uh I wanted to like break out in the web 3 space as an auditor of sorts uh doing freelance work and that would those gaps failed I was kind of applying my operational security knowledge there's not really much of difference between web 2 and web3 sec concepts so I actually started doing some opsec reviews for different web 3 companies. </p> <p>Is there anything else you would like to know or clarified?</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Andy%20Li%20Podcast/20230928_Alex%20the%20Entreprenerd%20on%20Freelancing%2C%20Business%20and%20Internal%20Security%20Practices/","title":"Alex the Entreprenerd on Freelancing, Business and Internal Security Practices","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20230928</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9PgvDVNIn0</p> <p>Here's a comprehensive summary of the YouTube video \"Alex the Entreprenerd on Freelancing, Business and Internal Security Practices,\" presented in a Q&amp;A format.</p> <p>Overview: The interview with Alex (the Entreprenerd) focuses on his experiences with freelancing in cybersecurity, diving into the world of web3, private audits, discussing practical insights, including the importance of consistent effort, the influence of gaming, and shifting his perspectives.</p> <p>Part 1: Entering Web3 and Freelancing (0:00 - 13:41)</p> <ul> <li>Q: What led you to consider full-time work in Web3, and when approximately did this happen?</li> <li> <p>A: It was around September/October of last year (2022) when he started seriously considering a full-time move into Web3. It felt like the natural next step to him.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: Before private audits, what did Entreprenerd do as activities on platforms like CodeMentor?</p> </li> <li> <p>A: Before private audits, what I did as activities on platforms like code Mentor was \"It was pretty much just like I almost thought working at a firm was my only option.

Security is more of a personal passion.</li> </ul> <p>Early Journey into Security and Web3:</p> <ul> <li>Q: How did you get started with security, and how did that evolve into Web3?</li> <li>A: The interviewee's interest in security began prior to Web3. They participated in TCM Academy's PNP course to understand security, after which they also engaged in offensive security and web2 bug bounties.. Seeing mention of Web3 through Parsley's podcast and tweets piqued their interest. He jumped into the practical ethical hacking side first.</li> </ul> <p>Experience with Y Academy zBlock:</p> <ul> <li>Q: How did you enter Y Academy's zBlock program, and what was the application process like?</li> <li> <p>A: The interviewee found the application process for zBlock highly competitive. He'd previously applied without success for Y Academy's Solidity block so was glad to get general access to the ZK block before later being properly onboarded.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: What were your experiences with the course material during zBlock?</p> </li> <li>A: The course structure was top-class with progressive approach which was great given he needed to brush up on maths. He thought that this progressive learning and maths elements helped in figuring out how zero knowledge works.</li> </ul> <p>Web2 vs. Web3 Security + Learning ZK</p> <ul> <li>Q: Web3 is newer than Web2 and has lots of new stuff to consider. Where does your caution come in as an ethical security researcher</li> <li> <p>A: The open-source nature of Web3 (smart contracts) allows anyone to see the code and easily scrutinize it by getting access to testing/production environments. The ability to audit the code made it a very exciting space as it differs greatly from Web2. The focus is on finding and fixing vulnerabilities before exploitation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: How do the privacy aspects of ZK fit into your security passion?</p> </li> <li>A: For an older hacker learning zk/Noir it helps in the fact that the private element really was fun for me um and being able to prove something was also fun as zk was a great way to be involved again.</li> </ul> <p>Challenges of Learning While Working Full-Time:</p> <ul> <li>Q: What are the biggest challenges you face learning ZK and Web3 concepts with a full-time job?</li> <li>A: balancing a full-time job coupled with a newborn was cited. He found solace in that the course was designed in a progressive way allowing him to do bits at a time.</li> </ul> <p>Time Management and Learning Strategies:</p> <ul> <li>Q: How do you schedule time for learning with a full-time job and family?</li> <li>A: After the family is settled in the evening, he allocates time until about 10 PM. Weekend time is allocated as follows with Saturdays being mostly for self-study. After doing the family \"bits\", just before the 6pm - 10pm run, he will first get the most important things done to put himself into hyperfocus.</li> </ul> <p>Advice and Recommendations:</p> <ul> <li>Q: What advice would you give to others interested in learning ZK, Web3, and Solidity while working full-time?</li> <li> <p>A:</p> </li> <li> <p>Be prepared put in the hard work and go down numerous rabbit holes to make the correct decision. This is better long-term as there is no substitute for personal study.</p> </li> <li>Recognize that it is hard and you can't just immediately jump in to compete in security protocols without understanding the math fully.</li> <li>Find something you love and which makes you happy as that is what will keep you going.</li> <li>Drip feed yourself little bit a lot so that eventually that will harden into muscle.</li> <li>Do all the study for yourself and make sure that integrity is maintained for you. Do not do two things and then make yourself feel bad later.</li> <li> <p>See if what is in the course and how they want to teach you. You need to understand how it will work and not just go in blindly.</p> <p>Other good resources can be the Y Academy Website but see Spearbit or Hacken as a solid first pass to take in. This does not guarantee everything will be right as everyone will have different resources/perceptions.</p> </li> </ul> <p>I hope this summary is helpful!</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Andy%20Li%20Podcast/20231013_Lucas%20Calderon%20on%20Building%20AI%20Security%20Tooling%20and%20Web3%20Security/","title":"Lucas Calderon on Building AI Security Tooling and Web3 Security","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20231013</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qv27bOrxOc</p> <p>Here's a summarized version of the interview, focusing on the core ideas and structured in a Q&amp;A format.</p> <p>Part 1: Background and Journey</p> <p>Q: You started with YouTube about two, three years back, then you transitioned to three at that time it was actually quite a tough moment for you Entrepreneurship in terms of your startup and so on.</p> <p>A: His initial YouTube content and podcasts motivated him to keep going during tough entrepreneurial times.</p> <p>Q: You mentioned your startup, was that a pen testify</p> <p>A: Pentestify is his second startup. His first exit was in automated pentesting for Web 2.0.</p> <p>Q: So, your previous job allowed you to go out there and find clients and do freelance work on the side. What kind of things do we see?</p> <p>A: He has a background in ethical hacking, specifically in Web 2.0. He couldn't resist transitioning into Web3 security.</p> <p>Part 2: Comparing Web2 &amp; Web3 Security</p> <p>Q: How do you compare the two?</p> <p>A: The worlds of web2 &amp; Web3 are completely different</p> <ul> <li>Web2: Security is sequential with a more established methodology.</li> <li>Web3: There are so many things jumping from one contract to another and are picked up for value maximization. Need to think spatially way more.</li> </ul> <p>Part 3: AI and Security</p> <p>Q: What sort of AI's that you work with back then and has it improved a lot nowadays?</p> <p>A:</p> <ul> <li>Initially focused on ethical hacking in Web 2.</li> <li>Joined an AI team at a bank, motivated by fearing AI's potential threat.</li> <li>Uses AI to automate vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, but avoids using public or \"off-the-shelf\" AI models/tools. It is important to develop proprietary one, but not everything can be automated.</li> <li>Developed models in-house, combined with graphs. He feels this approach is spatially different than in Web 2. This a transition between that one.</li> </ul> <p>Part 4: Startup's Differentiator &amp; Challenges in Web3 Security</p> <p>Q: It was quite tough in fact I remain differentiator.</p> <p>A: His Pen Testify startup's differentiator: it combines his deep knowledge of both AI &amp; blockchain/Web3 security. and automate the process.</p> <p>Q: And were you to talk a little about the challenges that you see around the blockchain infrastructure side of Web3 auditing and so on, where's that is very underdeveloped now in terms of market.</p> <p>A: Web3 is underdeveloped for auditing with a whole spectrum unfulfilled and needs lots of trust and recognition with people's reputation and market.</p> <p>Part 5: Strategies for Success and Insights</p> <p>Q: What are the strategies for success and the keys?</p> <p>A:</p> <ul> <li>Finding independent clients is tough, requires connections. Approach directly wasn't enough.</li> <li>A key factor is knowing AI and automation well, continuous monitoring and avoiding false positives.</li> <li>With British people, if they see the values you bring, even though we might be out of um you know, the framework that they've set, they will most likely allow it if he doesn't clash with their own interests.</li> </ul> <p>Part 6: Navigating AI's Role &amp; Skills for the Future</p> <p>Q: What is his perspective on the rise of \"open\" AI and general purpose AI tools?</p> <p>A: Thinks their only undervalue is how scary people were wasn't actually that was, that was kind of the underlying how literal people were scared about the technology and then you want to put him on it. AI is a very overhyped, underdog. Can't apply that in the real world.</p> <p>People cannot trust AI because AI has a lot of responsibility to hold</p> <p>Q: What are the skills should a smart contract auditor has so his/her stills can be upgraded and still relevant and more efficient with AI?</p> <p>A: It starts with the base first ethical hacking then you also need to know quite a bout Ai and automation so for and keep in pair with both of them.</p> <ul> <li>Avoid trading time for money always.</li> <li>The point of trading is creating solutions that do not exist.</li> </ul> <p>Part 7: Final Thoughts and The Future</p> <p>Q: What is your final thoughts that are good?</p> <p>A:</p> <p>*That for three space, the transition uh between that one and I am to take away any.</p> <p>As of right now and as long as I know so people, what is fantastic file.

A: I'm feeling good and great, it's a pleasure for me to be here and have a conversation with you about super exciting stuff.</p> <p>How I got introduced to Web3</p> <p>Q: How did you get into tech? A: I started when I was in high school and remembered this specific story back then. My teachers used to talk about this guy that graduated from my high school and started doing some IT-related stuff. They said he already bought a new flat/apartment at that time and I was like: \"How does he do this?\". I grew up pretty poor, I mean, I didn't have much opportunities. Then, I connected into the Tech space and eventually web3. I was in university when it clicked to me and where I've got.</p> <p>What I studied at University</p> <p>Q: So you have actually a degree from a university from Sofia A: Actually, I don't get my degree, I studied for 4 years and I dropped it in my second year because I started working for a company. So eventually, I started doing web3, blockchain, and transmitted to smart contracts audit.</p> <p>Shift from traditional IT to Web3 and Blockchain</p> <p>Q: So who was the first guy who told you about blockchains and crypto A: I was working at Nexo and building a centralized exchange, I learned a lot about exchanges, derivatives and financials. After one year, a blockchain-developer told me that he was going to start a senior blockchain development job at a Remote company, working on Solidity for 120k $ salary, so It was very very interesting for me.</p> <p>Q: Can you explain to our listeners Code4rena and Sherlock? A: It's basically the same model, a platform where you have security contests time-bounded. So you have 7 days where you have a open code source repository for some smart contracts related to some D5 protocol. Then, you can upload this report on Code Arena. And if actually they find like one bug/vulnerability you are guaranteed to get some payout. But if it's duplicated, the rewards will be distributed in the person who submited first. The Rewards are very good, around 50K dollars is very big amount of money. Actually I got Spirit without and Ox security.</p> <p>Recent Successes and Current Involvement</p> <p>Q: So how is it going with Code4rena and Sherlock? A: Great. First of all just as a small disclaimer, I'm not that advanced you're saying I'm killing it, but I'm just starting it. I think I have just passed the first beginner level which is great</p> <p>About Security Audit and Payouts</p> <p>Q: Can more than one person find and submit the same vulnerability? A: What happens is that the tester that\u2019s the Code4rena model gives value to the protocol by finding vulnerabilities and reporting these issues to them. Then, the auditor assesses it and judges them as valid. In that way the tester is directly responsible for fixing certain issues within the solidity code. If more testers identify the same vulnerability in the code, then the price associated with fixing that piece of code is split amongst the testers. If, however, a tester submits a vulnerability that is already recognised, by virtue of an earlier tester having submitted the same vulnerability, first, then the later tester will receive reduced recompense. This motivates and incetivises speed within the tester community.</p> <p>Q: So it's good there is a lot of competition? A: As an auditor you depend basically on a mix of skill and luck. But all what you control has too be juiced and everything needs to be your best, at maximum of your capabilities.</p> <p>The switch to Web3 security:</p> <p>A: So then I thought that that was what I was gonna do, because the amounts are extremely high on salaries. I found another reason to switch the thing with this security because there was no enough people to resolve those kind of stuff so after, as security is so important, I wanted to switch on that.</p> <p>Recent and Future Goals:</p> <p>My recent goal, as you said, was the four figure reward and next year is make five figures reward or get a partnership for Spirit DAO</p> <p>Q: What are you thinking for future and recent goals on this space? A: With those goals, I want to have more public speaking events I want to start helping people to get their salary and have also some financial and career goals too</p> <p>Hacks</p> <p>Q: Do you remember what was your first hack that you see related on web3? A: I saw this vulnerability in some token that was using transactional origin for authentication, which was the first time I know when I'm in school that somebody earned money for those audits</p> <p>Excitement about Ox Security and Spirit DAO:</p> <p>A: it was exciting joining Ox and security and Spirit DAO and working to do better EVMs, it helps create more value</p> <p>Tools</p> <p>Q: What tool do you find to be helpful and or the best way to find bugs in solidity and auditing the code? A: Mastering etherum is a fantastic book and highly effective at beginner levels. All that is needed after that is to use existing tools such as Slither and then apply these models to contracts being scrutinised. Even though certain protocols use EVM audits some companies actually then use cross-chain equivalents.</p> <p>Journey to Code4rena</p> <p>Q: So how was your experience on Code4rena and Sherlock? A: I went a little bit prepared but they say that everything is free on the internet so you can get on Google Search read some information and learn everything so i went to this test and the test consisted of 60 questions in 50 minutes and the test was very hard</p> <p>Tips for newcomers:</p> <ul> <li>Start with the securing boot camp</li> <li>Read a lot of high-quality audits</li> <li>Be active</li> </ul> <p>Daily Routine:</p> <p>A: About daily routine, I don't like or believe on routines where you have to wake up at 5 o'clock make some activity that makes anything. If you want to learn or improve, your things will be done well in a more natural mode</p> <p>Impact of FTX and the Bear Market</p> <p>Despite negative events, it is believed that quality development can still mean a positive outlook to people and the general space on web3.</p> <p>It's time to go</p> <p>Q: And with the conclusion to finish, you want to say thanks or shout something? A: I want to say thanks for everything and have been a pleasure been in the podcast, bye bye</p> <p>That's a comprehensive overview of the interview, highlighting the key points discussed.</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Jhonny%20Time%20Web3%20Security%20Interviews/20221207_He%20was%20MY%20FIRST%20in%20Ethereum%2C%20Illuvium%2C%20and%20PancakeSwap/","title":"He was MY FIRST in Ethereum, Illuvium, and PancakeSwap","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20221207</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZT_hVq4eXs</p> <p>Okay, here's the summary of the YouTube video, based on the transcript, in a conversational format:</p> <p>Intro (0:00 - 0:29)</p> <p>I began the video by introducing my guest, Nitsan, as one of my best friends and the person who introduced me to Ethereum, Illuvium, and other opportunities in the crypto space. I call him a genius and one of the smartest investors I've ever met.</p> <p>Getting to know Nitsan (0:29 - 2:10)</p> <p>Q: Nitsan, could you tell us more about your experience and background? A: Sure. I've been developing websites for over 10 years. I had several apps and websites in the internet space. I had a business of content arbitrage, buying a lot of traffic from social networks. Now, I'm focused on investing in crypto and stocks, plus a little travel.</p> <p>Q: So you're basically 'retired', investing, and travelling. That's what you're doing these days? A: Yes investing and traveling, but sometimes, you know I work on the side for little arbitrage in internet businesses for content websites. Still very updated in the crypto industry and always looking for new opportunities, new projects and buying new things.</p> <p>Getting into Crypto (2:10 - 8:01)</p> <p>Q: Nitsan, who introduced you to crypto, and what was the experience like? What made you look into blockchains?</p> <p>A: Well, 2013, after the Army, I started looking for new opportunities and getting into the tech industry</p> <p>Well, after I finished the Army I started to look for new opportunities in the tech industry and I think it was also an articles in the in the website in the internet and we start to talk about it about Bitcoin but it was there was, it was like very weird and something you know like like underground very underground scene. But I wanted to find ways to get find ways to buy but it was not so easy but I just buy Bitcoin from people and yeah it was it was crazy it was and I I started to go to comfort to meanings to meet the a the Bitcoin Bitcoin community and its it's uh yeah, it was very interesting so Bitcoin came to to to me from from some friend and um I think it was also a article in uh in the in the website in in the internet and people start to talk about it about Bitcoin</p> <p>Q: So, in 2013 when you started there was a lot of \"underground things\"? A: Exactly, it was all weird.</p> <p>Q: So, I hear that a lot that back then was really was weird and you came to me with Ethereum A: The Bitcoin community was small and I didn't think it was strange.</p> <p>Q: Let's jump into knowing what is traffic arbitrage.</p> <p>A: Traffic arbitrage is working from very from very very long time you I don't know how many years uh it is similar to affiliate it is similar to affiliate but it's mostly mostly on it's like doing arbits arbitrage between uh ads companies, OK? for example you If you have have a website so you can monetize the website with several you have many options you can monetize it with uh like Google Ads or with uh Taboola or outbrain or many many companies Okay? and also you can you can buy traffic traffic for your website with uh in social networks like Facebook or Tick Tock. um So it's like very interesting uh industry and the arbitrages in general you buy traffic from companies and sell traffic for some companies and you just make profit for from the the the gap between the the companies that's cool that's amazing</p> <p>First experience with Ethereum (8:01 - 13:07)</p> <p>Q: So you were the first one who told me about Ethereum and what was your I know that actually before I met you I heard about Bitcoin Litecoin back there in 2014 so from another friend but you were the first man who told me Man Ethereum is is the next thing you have too you have to learn about it too you'll have to learn about this smart contracts these Central these Centralized applications I was like Nissan what the hell are you talking about let's do some traffic a bit Rush let's do money.</p> <p>A: Yeah yeah yeah ethereum was I think maybe in 2007 where I have no idea what is ethereum what are smart contracts and I just remember that I know it's Bitcoin I know that it's a cryptocurrency and you can mine it and Litecoin a little bit and Dodge Coin was there and Nissan came to me one day Jonathan listen you have to invest in ethereum you have to learn about it this is amazing you can write smart contracts on the blockchain Create decentralized application I was like Nissan what the hell are you talking about let's do some traffic little rush let's do money in the internet affiliate marketing stuff, so Could you tell us more about your</p> <p>Investing in early Ethereum ICOs (13:07 -22:29)</p> <p>Q: It's super cool and that you said something about traffic arbitrage.</p> <p>A: Yeah, I'm developing websites. Um for uh um over than 10 years. I had several apps websites in the internet and uh I have I had a business of content arbitrage, we bought a lot of traffic from social networks and yeah it worked several years and now I'm now I'm uh focused on investing, You know, uh a crypto and also stocks.</p> <p>Q:So basically you are travelling Investing and travelling so you are basically retired investing and traveling that's what you are doing these days [Laughter] A: It's investing, um you know uh</p> <p>Q:I know in 2002 we bought Bitcoin and ethereum let's talk about that. A: Yea, we bought Bitcoin very early during 2013 and 2014 and Uh yeah but also Uh sometimes I work on on the like Uh arbitrage and like internet businesses um kind of uh content websites, but uh especially uh you know I'm looking for a for a for pro. I'm very updated in the in the crypto industry and looking for new projects investing Uh buying Uh like new new Thing new new projects Uh now you know especially like mostly looking. a great uh new opportunities that's that's amazing so so you're investing in crypto and stocks that super cool and you said Something About Traffic Abitrage so both you and I know is what traffic Habitats are with for us because we used to to do it together</p> <p>Traffic Arbitrage (22:29 - 29:50)</p> <p>Q:I don't think our listeners quite understand what it is, they probably think we're talking about crypto or like trading. What is traffic arbitrage?</p> <p>A: Yeah sure traffic Arbitrage it's it's uh it's uh it's working for I don't know how many years uh it's similar to affiliate it is similar to affiliate but it's mostly on. it's doing Arbitrage between uh ads company for example you If you have website so you can monetize the website with several you have many options you can monetize it with a Google Ads or with uh Taboola or outbrain you know and also you can you can buy traffic for your website with uh in in social networks like Facebook or Tick Tock um so like a very interesting uh industry and the the arbits is in general he buy traffic from some comanios and sell Traffic for some companies and you just make profit for from the the gap between the the companies</p> <p>Q:That's cool. So you basically have a website and then you buy traffic from one source with, let's say one dollar per 100 impressions and you sell it for AD companies for two dollars making 100 revenue, which we call ROI.</p> <p>First Exposure to Crypto (29:50 - 40:30)</p> <p>Q:Nitsan, who introduced you to crypto, How did you find out about blockchain about bitcoin? A:Good in 2013 to 2013 Uh after I uh finished the Army. Uh I I went out to the I started to to look for a new opportunities. um Like getting into the the tech and industry. Um I heard about uh Bitcoin from some friends and um I think it was also a article in uh in the in the website and people start to talk about it about Bitcoin, but it was there was it was like very weird and something you know like like underground very Underground scene.</p> <p>Q:And what did you think about it back then?</p> <p>A:I told myself it's not a thing what is. It's crazy.</p> <p>Q:What that was your experience now? A:First time when I thought to create cryptocurrency.</p> <p>Q:Could Bitcoin be the main new digital currency? A: I believe it was a genius and and uh I started to to Buy uh uh try to to to find ways to to buy it and it was not so easy but I I just both it bought Bitcoins from uh from people and uh yeah it was it was very it was and I I started to go </p> <p>Early Bitcoin Meetups (40:30 - 44:50)</p> <p>Q:What was that? I thought meetups where people were talking crazy about \"Dodge Coin\"</p> <p>A:and and so for the meeting that so for the meetups it was uh like like only 10 people crazy people um, you know we have two buy a medical internet money you know yeah yeah it was it was very a weird weird come community and uh very Not unusual yeah okay so were you involved in this community in such ways or are you just what can you tell us about like some some kind of event where you went what did they talk about were you involved in something it was what it's it was in uh 2013 to uh 2013 Uh and uh yeah it it was also in the uh in the Israeli um especially in Telaviv</p> <p>First Experience with Ethernet &amp; Tokenomics (44:50 - 57:30)</p> <p>Q: What got you to be the first time when he brought to what is your experience in that that's like how did you found of cripto about blockchains and who was the the guy who introduced it to a cripto okay yeah it's a good good in 2013 too.</p> <p>A: Well, and how do they use the ICO to do it so they try to do something some sort of something like a theory of I bought several coins it's a little bit funny now Q: Ethereum will be the next think the first time you told me to this so, I want to ask you the experience of the time you first invested the Bitcoin of 40 A: yeah yeah uh Ethereum was I think hundred no maybe 40 40 dollars the way it's that's Nissan that in why I wanted to bring him on the show</p> <p>Traffic Arbitrage (57:30 - 61:50)</p> <p>Q:so you, you have to try what traffic is A: it was traffic Habitats for us because we used to do uh traffic average yeah sure traffic arbitrage it's it's uh it's uh it's working for I don't know how many years uh it's similar to affiliate it is similar to affiliate but it's mostly on it's like doing arbits arbitrage between uh ads companies</p> <p>Ethereum Smart Contracts (61:50 - 75:42)</p> <p>Q:So Nissan I said to you Jonathan listed you have to to invest in you know in ethereum you have to to learn about it so what are ethereum? A: I know that it you know that</p> <p>Q: What did you think about Bitcoin? A: Bitcoin is that crazy</p> <p>Early ICOS (75:42 - 88:20)</p> <p>Q:Who told you abot illuvium - You told me and let's look into pancake swap A:And after I don't know the time from there where it is I want I take back at 50%</p> <p>Bear Marketing with Big Company (88:20 - 98:44)</p> <p>Q:Do you think there a bear marketing with big companies? A:You just said about what we bought.</p> <p>Web 3 with more control (98:44 - 1:18:00)</p> <p>Q: I really see. Why this all comes up because the web 3 is getting more control and more people have and this is what you told me. A: Yes exactly</p> <p>Disclaimer 1/18:00 - the last minute</p> <p>Q: Everything that we tell is not financial advice</p> <p>A: You have to see to new technology and find something good</p> <p>So, that\u2019s the gist of the interview, covering investments, early crypto experience and the importance of timing and research in this ever-evolving market.</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Jhonny%20Time%20Web3%20Security%20Interviews/20230331_Starkswap%20Team%20Interview%20%26%20Ginger%20Security%20Cairo%20Smart%20Contract%20Auditing%20Review/","title":"Starkswap Team Interview &amp; Ginger Security Cairo Smart Contract Auditing Review","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20230331</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EowcwcSM2sU</p> <p>Okay, here is a comprehensive summary of the YouTube video titled \"Starkswap Team Interview &amp; Ginger Security Cairo Smart Contract Auditing Review\".</p> <p>Intro:</p> <p>Q: General intro to the video.</p> <p>A: Hello everyone, I\u2019m Johnny Time, and in this video I have the pleasure of speaking with the team behind Starkswap which the speaker calls the biggest AMM and decentralised exchange on StarkNet. We will also touch upon the audit that Ginger Security did for Starkswap's Cairo smart contracts, which are built atop StarkNet. StarkNet is a leading Layer 2 ZK-rollup solution sitting on top of Ethereum.</p> <p>Part 1: Interview with Starkswap Team</p> <p>Q: Can you tell us about how you guys got into crypto and how you started with StarkNet leading to building Starkswap?</p> <p>A: Median explained that he and Brand Builder were working together in their day jobs. They both had been in crypto since 2017 and had a passion for the space. They were exposed to StarkNet and thought their project was cool. The idea was to have a cheaper and faster transaction throughput, which was exciting to them.</p> <p>Q: How did you come up with the idea for Starkswap?</p> <p>A: Median continues to explain about scoping out the StarkNet ecosystem early on and recognized a core primitive such as an Automated Market Maker (AMM) was missing . Brand Builder says the focus was always on what kind experience they could build in Defi because there needs to be a solution for trustless and decentralized security.</p> <p>Q: Could you tell us more about features besides the AMM?</p> <p>A: Further into the conversation, they talk about Iron Fleet, a D5 pooling protocol, they'd later added helps users you know with interoperability between one layer and layer one, L2. It helps also to share the gas fees in the long run.</p> <p>Q: What made you chose to built using StarkNet compared to other L2 solutions?</p> <p>A: Again I believe the decision to choose StarkNet was the built in focus on native and decentralized security. Also, the speaker mentions that they know those that are at StarkWare and the developers. They\u2019re able to have an advantage that way.</p> <p>Q: When can investors expect Starkswap on mainnet?</p> <p>A: Mainnet launch is targeted for March 1st but they will shift to later if everything is not in place before that time while a new version of Cairo is on the horizon.</p> <p>Part 2: Interview with Gershon from Ginger Security</p> <p>Q: Gershon, introduce yourself to the audience.</p> <p>A: Gershon began by saying that Ginger Security performed the audit for Starkswap.</p> <p>Q: What is your methodology when coming into smart contract auditing, expecially one written in Cairo.</p> <p>A: Gershon begins to answer about ZK rollups are more secure than Optimistic rollups, but that has been thoroughly tested at the beginning by reading and analyzing all code. I go over the code multiple times to fully undnerstand what the contract is fully doing and what it was implemented.</p> <p>Q: Do you plan further iterations now that the core protocol has been deployed? </p> <p>A: Yes, the Ginger Security team plan to implement new features to make sure that contracts have upgradedability to help security measures on these smart contracts written in cairo.</p> <p>Conclusion:</p> <p>Key Points: These were the key points discussed between both the two teams.

I'll use the \"Q:\" and \"A:\" format, speaking from my own perspective, and break it down according to the flow of the video.</p> <p>Introduction</p> <p>Q: Alright guys welcome to another web3 security interview today we have \"dravi\". Can you tell us he's an Awesome web3 security researcher with so many accomplishments and I'm very proud to have him on the show. I am super excited to hear about all your experiences and how you transition into web3 security and all the interesting stories and Alpha that we're gonna share with the viewers today. So how are you, \"dravi\", good to have you here?</p> <p>A: Yeah thank you Johnny for taking your time, enjoying time to make that joke, uh I'm fine really fine. Uh in fact, uh really happy to be here again thank you you excited and how are you?</p> <p>Q: Awesome awesome thank you I'm really happy that actually, I, want to tell you guys a fun story uh we just connected on Discord very randomly and we just started speaking and we just set a meeting just to meet and greet and just to discuss a bit and the conversation was so interesting we really had a good connection and we talked aboust very interesting thing and then we thought about why not to put it in an interview so all these interesting conversation you guys can enjoy it and learn from it as well and that's why we're doing this interview and it's going to be super fun and I'm great and yeah. So the first thing that I would like to ask you is before we Deep dive into web3 security is like if you are if you were like me because I was a computer geek nerd I mean since like child hood.</p> <p>A: So I'm about let's say 10 years older than you so I couldn't have started on computers at the time I mean 10 years 10 years wait wait wait we gotta We gotta make this uh Right</p> <p>Q: Oh all right no so not 10 years but I'm in my 30s so okay go ahead.</p> <p>Dravee's Background and Journey into Tech and Web3 Security</p> <p>Q: Yeah? I couldn't start with computers. Uh, the first few ones I was hearing, you know, the the 56k connections, and, I did hear them quite a bit. Uh, I know what the 3d printing of the... the save icon, is!</p> <p>Q:  Yeah! No it's a floppy disk.</p> <p>A:  Yeah, yeah! Um I did start with screen, and games pretty soon, like at four years old.</p> <p>Q: Oh wow!.</p> <p>A:  Actually during most of my childhood, and even later I wasn't really interested in many things other than games and computers. What was was your background connected to the computers. How did you start your relationship with computer?</p> <p>A: So, I'm talking about let's say 10 years older than you, so I couldn't have started on computers at that time. I mean 10 years before, 10 years, we've gotta... we gonna make this right?</p> <p>Q: Oh, alright no, so, not 10 years, but I'm in my 30s.  So okay, go ahead.</p> <p>A: Yeah, I couldn't start with computers. The first few one, I was hearing, you know, the the 56K connections and the uh, I did hear them quite a bit so I know what the the 3D printing of the the save icon is. know, that yeah, nowaday people say why did you 3D print uh save this save icon, yeah no, it's, a floppy disk yeah, yeah!</p> <p>Q:Yeah. Yeah, Yeah! Um I did start uh with screens, and games pretty soon, like at four years old and actually during most of my childhood and even Later, I wasn't really interested in many things other than games and computers</p> <p>Q: um when I had my first laptop at 12 I started reading a lot about computers and how it's uh how it works and such and at a year later at 13.</p> <p>A: I put some money on the side I actually decided to build my own computer. Like, I couldn't really play on a laptop back then, it was, really expensive.</p> <p>Q: So, each pieces and each slot, how, their was, this, and that,  so, I... Did build my, own computer at 13, really, wasn't too,  all, that, So yes it started, pretty, soon, and, I, was, so very much, into, into games, really, built, um, built me, some, nice, memories, too. And that's, it, I, have, a very, nice, playlist, now, of of music, so, yeah!</p> <p>Q:  From from the old computer games, like, I, don't, even, remember, the name, like, Doom.</p> <p>A: And Keen. And then, you, know, later, on, also, MMORPG games, and I always was interested in computers, and playing games, and  this, is how I, got, into, actually, development and IT and eventually Cyber security and web3 security and I'm interested, what was, your, background, connected, to, computers, like, how, did you start, your relationship, with, computers.</p> <p>A: So I'm above 10, and let's say 10 years older than you So I couldn't have started on computers at the time.</p> <p>Transition to Cybersecurity and Web3</p> <p>Q: Alright all right oh all right no so not, 10 years, but, I'm, in, my, 30s, so so okay go ahead, but yeah I couldn't start with computers, the first few one I was hearing you know the 56k connections</p> <p>A: at childhood I used to play computer games, old games, doom, Keen, Mmorpg even, and I was always interested in computers and playing game. This is how I got into the development and eventually cyber security.</p> <p>Q: and then cybersecurity and web3 security and I'm interested, what was, your, background, connected, to, computers, like,how did you start your relationship with Computers?</p> <p>A: Yeah! I couldn't start with computers.The first few one, I was hearing, the the 56k connections and the uh</p> <p>Q: You, built computers at 13, when did you start coding?</p> <p>A: I was playing but did I advanced stuff, 15, but never really dedicated. The engineering job had then and the side playing was trying some Unity building games and so many apps at some point.</p> <p>Q: After MapleStory? (a MMORPG example before)</p> <p>A: Games were the motivation. I am grateful it improve thinking.</p> <p>Q: Grateful?How extreme you are in games but how did motivated you and computer</p> <p>A:  It adds, a lot of value and improves thinking. English also learning playing cause to talk and trade. So yeah, you know, when you are Young, you're actually downloading.</p> <p>Q: Download games? illegal.</p> <p>A: No, is free to play. Maplestory for example you wanna hack advantage to get into forum found cheat engine and memory manipulation. This helps motivate for learning about computers.</p> <p>Q: Experience related web2 cyber security ex hacking malwares?</p> <p>A: No, actually Spent time for years front stack. Earned MBA and then went to Dev ops and project management</p> <p>Q: What about hacker one experience back then? Can you share?</p> <p>A:  On web2 bountees was kinda limited, Crow Integrity etc, I work I do don\u2019t know location they had the ctf with XSS and had really good time, with very nice community.. Now moving on so what are web3 how did you start?</p> <p>Q:What web3 made what? How did you start?</p> <p>A:  Noo! Spend like at first to end the full stack for years and transition there but bored and I had much into web2  learn about Bug bountry hunting programs. It is always like oh, what does it legally attack? you can attack, but legally and get rewarded for it,</p> <p>Dravee's Work at Soteria</p> <p>Q: What about Soratora? and what's that you like doing.</p> <p>A: First have technical part then the 3D save icon, now all in my 30 what I was doing was that and is good it\u2019s interesting , You totally can create a profile etc on website to find I had relationship before.</p> <p>Q: Ok, what this look what did all these do. Also, yeah.</p> <p>A: As said, to find I think I\u2019m putting sometime back music in is game. So yeah wow music Zelda Pokemon .. lots of stuff Sonic Wow</p> <p>Thoughts on the Present and Future of Web3 Security</p> <p>Q: As far, there with no, all of this. In that that's what you can do now to your side. There are there a lot that it's so really. excited to be like all this this conversation you you guys and can enjoy it and learn from it as well and that's why we're doing this interview and it's going to be super fun and I'm. A:I\u2019m not a road map, for other you understand all that</p> <p>Q: All right oh all right not, 10, years, but I'm, in, my, 30s so okay go ahead, but yeah A:I couldn't start with computers, The first one, I was hearing, you know, the, 56 C connections And the, uh, I did. Did hear them quite a bit so I know is what the 3d for the safe iPhone it's no it's, floppy</p> <p>Q: Now it\u2019s easy you.</p> <p>A: So it really not. Q: So, the first thing that I would like to ask you is, before we Deep dive into web3 security, is, like, if you are, if you were like me, because I was a, computer geek, nerd, I mean, since, like childhood. A: To auditing, I just, putting sometimes on online MapleStory, back, on music, and it just, feels like, uh, game for me, so it's, like, instead, of, like, and that's even, what you're you're not even, interrupt, by.</p> <p>Q:Oh right, ahahah so yeah, cuz playlist you I can totally relate no regrets, either, 56k connections.</p> <p>Okay!</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Jhonny%20Time%20Web3%20Security%20Interviews/20230620_2%20Hours%20Web3%20Smart%20Contract%20Security%20Interview%20with%20Dravee/#the-interview-structure","title":"The Interview Structure","text":"<ul> <li>Initial Q&amp;A: How are you?

As the Interviewer says, \"It's crazy\".</p> <p>Chris's Background, Early Start with Computers (0:56 - 2:33):</p> <p>Q: How did you get started with computers at such a young age</p> <p>A: I responded that my start was unorthodox, it started when I was six or seven years old playing things like GTA. I started doing more interesting stuff like Minecraft and I believe that this was when the seeds were sowed to what would become a career.</p> <p>Q: What kind of games did you play?</p> <p>A: To be honest I started odd. I began with mainstream games and from those days, I actually began playing Minecraft like most kids.</p> <p>Q: At age of 14 , what was your tech stack?</p> <p>A: HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and a bit of Java. More than two years ago.</p> <p>Transition to Blockchain &amp; Web3 (2:33 - 12:00):</p> <p>Q: How and when did you transition to the world of web3 and blockchain.</p> <p>A: Since everything revolves around Minecraft, that's where I met people in the blockchain space. I then started learning first PHP</p> <p>Q: So how did everything converge toward smart-contract auditing?</p> <p>A: Well, back in October 2022, Pashov told me about smart contract security on Discord. I started learning Solidity. He said it's different from classic web2 hacking. I got involved with the blockchain security community. After learning Solidity, it made great sense.</p> <p>Smart Contract Hacking Course, Audits and Prizes (12:00 - 19:00):</p> <p>Q: What did you like about this specific course you were taking.</p> <p>A: So he always promotes Web3 Security audits and that in itself was very interesting. I liked that it has a great community.</p> <p>Q: How were you able to make $5,500 last month</p> <p>A: By competing to earn money. To actually simplify processes toward someone learning solidity. Try to explain complex concepts and in terms where chat is for kid brain to understand</p> <p>Q : As of the creation of this video, are you still involved in the course</p> <p>A: Now, yes I am and I find it helpful.</p> <p>Mindset Shift (19:00 - 23:10):</p> <p>Q : What is now your new mindset</p> <p>A: The Key For me was to actually not just write code but build and also breaking the code as we do it. When I first started with the course, there are a lot of complex spheres which, I admit, was extremely intimidating to me. But I had to change my mindset on the code and approach it from a \"How can I break it now?\" mindset</p> <p>The Importance of simplifying Information (23:10 - 27:00):</p> <p>Q: In essence, since you are still very young, does simplifying your information help your creativity</p> <p>A : It helps to reduce the anxiety. Simplifying helps me think that like I had a friend and I need forward this information so, how can I make it most easy to explain so this information is easily digestable</p> <p>Career Goals(27:00 - 32:10):</p> <p>Q: Being only 16 what are your goals in 90 days or even in a year</p> <p>A: Well, I do everything as I move. With having friends that are professional computer experts always gave me another perspective. Before being a security professional expert I just wanted to make a few websites. I then wanted to learn how to code a secure website and protect my own interest</p> <p>The Importance of Web3 Security and the Future (32:10 - 45:42)</p> <p>Q: Since you have been able to earn some money and you want to do this professionally where and when did you decide to really dig in in Web3 security</p> <p>A : Well it was in a very natural way that I did proceed there. The catalyst to me actually pursuing this further was the Smart Contract Hacking Course. I met very talented people and in that, I thought that this could have some serious potential</p> <ul> <li>From here. Chris mentions the importance of surrounding yourself with brilliant people as a way to get into Web3 Security and also to learn from them. Chris also highlights how it's important to use real-world analogies to better digest and understand certain complicated processes, for example, viewing crypto tokens as a form of digital metal or viewing a smart contract as a vending machine with the ability to perform more than one function. For the final portion of the interview, they focus their conversation around the importance of finding a healthy balance between auditing, learning, and creating content.</li> </ul> <p>In short, the interview charts Chris's journey into Web3 security, emphasizing his early start, the role of community, and the unique blend of coding and adversarial thinking required for smart contract auditing..</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Jhonny%20Time%20Web3%20Security%20Interviews/20230714_Exclusive%202.5%20Hours%20NEW%20Interview%20with%20Pashov%2C%20the%20Most%20Booked%20Solo%20Smart%20Contract%20Auditor/","title":"Exclusive 2.5 Hours NEW Interview with Pashov, the Most Booked Solo Smart Contract Auditor","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20230714</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JmqHnkSlFI</p> <p>Okay, I'm ready to summarize the YouTube video \"Exclusive 2.5 Hours NEW Interview with Pashov, the Most Booked Solo Smart Contract Auditor\" based on the transcript you provided. Here's the summary in the requested format:</p> <p>Introduction (0:00 - 0:57)</p> <p>I am Johnny Time, and I welcome my audience to a special Web3 security interview. Today, I have a returning special guest, Pashov, known as the most booked smart contract auditor. I first interviewed him in October 2022, and now, many months later, I want to catch up with his incredible journey. I plan to share some tips about Web3 security, smart contract auditing, and hacking.</p> <p>Revisiting Past Goals (1:04 -8:32)</p> <ul> <li> <p>Q: Last time we talked about your future goals. Let's revisit those goals. First one, taking care of your family financially, how is that going?</p> </li> <li> <p>A:  I write down goals for myself every year, financial, lifestyle, friendship goals, and anything else. This was one of my main goals and it's pretty much done. Maybe even one or two years ago. I helped my mother and sister and they live a great life now in my hometown. Financial stability for myself and my family was the initial motivation to become a cybersecurity engineer. They are not people who want to flex with watches or cars, they are very well off even without much money.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: Another goal was public speaking and content creation. How is that going?</p> </li> <li> <p>A: In terms of content creation. I haven\u00b4t missed a single day of tweeting since your last interview. It is close to a year now. Some days I am tweeting more than once. People follow me so they like my tweets. I run my Discord community. Lately, is becoming web3 security stuff.     In terms of public speaking, is Okay for a third consecutive year. I did online webinar for my local for the local community here in Bulgaria about Web3, security related. I spoke about the different phases of product development and deployment life cycles and how to secure each.     I should have applied to be speaker at defy security Summit that is in 3 days. But, the process to apply is not good, sometimes you have to submit your CV as an independent Security, I don't have a cv.     There's still time, I might be applying for other public speaking conferences.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: Another goal regarding networking, meeting, and more people in web3security space. We're able to meet new people?</p> </li> <li> <p>A: I am meeting a lot of people, online, on Twitter, Discord, and Telegram. People have invited me to some private communities where just an small group of researchers discuss some things privately. I have built friendships and relationships. I visited Eth Montenegro, it wasn\u00b4t the best conference but I met some, people. This week, I am going to Paris for 5 days to the EthCC conference, where I am going to meet more people than in the last two years.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: Another goal for the future was to visit new places like USA or Miami,Were you able to visit those places?</p> </li> <li> <p>A: For the past 2 years I've been traveling at least once every month visiting some other countries since we spoke last time. I went to Barcelona, Nice, France, Monaco and Greece.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Auditing Goals (8:33 - end)</p> <ul> <li>Q: You wanted to bypass the plateau that you reach, you said that you read some kind of plateau and you wanted to win a five-digit reward.</li> <li>A: When we last talked it was exactly before I started doing solo audits, and two months after the interview, it happened, I got my first 10K payment. Therefore, I can say that goal was achieved. But nowadays, I\u00b4m not doing code arena or Sherlock contests.</li> <li>Q: I discussed it with Trust. He also started doing private audits. I asked: do you miss auditing contests? Why don't you participate anymore?</li> <li>A: It\u00b4s a better decision to do solo audits.</li> <li> <p>Q: What advice would you give to someone who doesn't know anything about Web3, or to a Security Researcher?</p> </li> <li> <p>A: First, get started. Start with resources like Patrick Collins's course and Securium's boot camp, and reading a lot. Then, participate in contests. When you hit a plateau, switch between all these different resources. Finally, start doing real Audits. You need to work to get experience.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"podcasts/Jhonny%20Time%20Web3%20Security%20Interviews/20230907_OpenZeppelin%20Space_%20Blockchain%20Security%20Across%20the%20Development%20Lifecycle/","title":"OpenZeppelin Space: Blockchain Security Across the Development Lifecycle","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20230907</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPvCpPVbX5A</p> <p>Okay, here's a summary of the YouTube video \"OpenZeppelin Space: Blockchain Security Across the Development Lifecycle\" from the perspective of the host, Johnny Time:</p> <p>Intro (0:00 - 96:00)</p> <p>Q: Welcome everyone to our Twitter space today, regarding blockchain security across the whole development cycle, when you develop depths or nfts.</p> <p>A: We're discussing blockchain security across the entire development lifecycle including coding, auditing, deployment, shipping to mainnet, and production. Today I'm happy that I have Emiliano, an independent web3 security researcher known for Library security research; Juan, a web security researcher from OpenZeppelin's services team, and Demi, founder and CEO of OpenZeppelin, who's been in crypto for over 10 years.</p> <p>Q: Let's have a short intro from each of our guests.</p> <p>A: I'm Johnny Time, co-founder and CEO of Ginger Security. We're a web3 security educator in the space. Also, creator of the smart contract hacking course, I'm glad to be here. I'm Emiliano, working in DeFi, Web3 since 2020. Better known as the rug world guy on the security side. I help a few protocols. Hi, I'm Juan, security researcher at OpenZeppelin. I have joined the company around five years ago versus a software engineer working in the smart contracts team and now working in the security services team.</p> <p>Q: Let's continue with a bit of introduction from Demi.</p> <p>A: Hi, I'm Demi, founder and CEO at OpenZeppelin. I've been in crypto for over 10 years and founded the company around eight years ago.</p> <p>Development Lifecycle and Security (1:00:00 - 206:00)</p> <p>Q: Demi, let's deep dive into app development lifecycle either if it's a D5 app or NFT app, it's a long process.</p> <p>A: We all have a model, that security needs to be throughout the whole process. You usually put most of your focus on auditing but even Audited protocols are getting hacked. Before to talk about the security aspect of it, can you briefly describe the development life cycle and the importance and stages? In our experience, working with thousands of blockchain developers, there is a good understanding of their processes, those are pre- and post-deployment you know. Planning and writing code and putting that on-chain. How do you operate that?</p> <p>Security of USA is not just a knowledge but a continuous effort. Security is a multi-layered approach, involving technology processes in people. Drawing inspiration from web2 security but adapting it to web3.</p> <p>In terms of stages, it starts with the plan phase, where devsecops practices can happen, to work what Integrations will be on a project. Then the project moves to the code phase, and then into the field and testing phases to build and test. After testing, there's a release phase. This is usually when projects get an audit once they finally got support and all the testing and the audit is done and pressing the \"red button\" and the project going to the chain.</p> <p>After deployments, overall monitoring operations, is a need. It involves tracking what's happening with the system, trying to understand behaviors, anomalies, and potential threats. That's based on those understandings, the team operates react and makes changes to back to the planning of the new cycle. This cycle then ends up being an infinite loop that makes products better.</p> <p>Critical Pain Points and Advice (2:06:00 - 277:00)</p> <p>Q: Emiliano, considering the whole life-cycle, which do you think is most critical, where we have the most pain?</p> <p>A: In my experience, every stage is a problem to have, but the probably most important part is the first part. First, I want to do an agreement about it, problem is not valid but I would say that probably the most important part is the first part because the the line becomes more harder to to make reversible decisions. When you arrive to the to the deployment then I can't be too late you know to change maybe some design decision because it would be very hard of to stop that we don't stop in any part of your protocol. Because if you cannot do otherwise you're so being able to have a good degree of control.</p> <p>Emiliano thinks the most important part of the development lifecycle is the planning and design because bad decisions there are harder and more costly to reverse later, as problems will have a cascade effect within the protocol . I think is that in general odd stuff is is finding a a good trade off to make the code efficient and ship quickly. Grammatory optimization are evil also from the web web too war that would like to be able to do something for in each of the part of your protocol but you but otherwise you would that you have access to those is something that you need to keep it at.</p> <p>Q: Emiliano please continue your explanation.</p> <p>A: Starting your planning phase is important even more when you are using ZK tech. All has to be aligned with the three pillars of security. You code have to be able to monitor efficiently and the ability to build dash boards over you code is great. In other words, your code efficiency and the ability is important, and must be very careful in what the access rights has to be for centralized admin and how can you keep this process on monitor and what should happen.</p> <p>If you are able to encode all information into the best practices, and then have a technologies so that that profits and best practice can be easily executed by each all of the people from the engineers.</p> <p>You all get the in Defender so is a cycle leads up being like look that makes that's a good idea. Uh it starts start starts with the in my experience, you what you wanna do, and you start code implement that the ends up something really. You can always have this to make. When everything has to make sense and ongoing to control, you really be control.</p> <p>Defender 2.0 and Security Awareness (277:00 - end) Q: Considering I'm from web3, can you elaborate on new features of Fender version 2.0?</p> <p>A: I have just one but I have pleasure the better and to see it's crazy webity security that it designed make. Not development coding the audit audit department is process make a products. To start a brief overview.</p> <p>The process is plan stages work the devsecup what those pages that start the phase know you re is it what what be how will Integrations will and the move testing and field. Build code teesting them your their differental after conducted you release usually projects audit finally support after done big moment the code chain the we deployment after get operations all. Behave potentials to those what one and react make goes the new</p> <p>Uh in odd things just that many protocols yeah researcher joining to the to a researcher one to. One what I was talking one to there are lot this</p> <p>Defenders is that it's the whole new level development for that makes it for and able the so.</p> <p>So with the new functions,Defender, there is a starts up, there is a plan you do want to do it this you code implement it you know the lens you . Those products . Uh I will start what do and at that's to to the best in the.</p> <p>I would be that we're bit web2 security and companies for years space that's thank intro and to our first want so lifecycle long process needs to.</p> <p>A challenge the whole needs the focus auditing section but not because audited getting hacked security briefly whole adapt stages include importance of working Zeppelin thousands of developers have understand look planning writing in the audit.</p> <p>Q&amp;A (2:09:00 - end)</p> <p>Q: If protocols deployed all the chain that's it</p> <p>A: Chain that's state you to overall monitor operation has understanding behaviors also an understanding operate to. U You have to to first the you know to plan stage is very understand. the end you have those.</p> <p>About the you need your the to is not just you keep changing.</p> <p>Also, a few questions for our guests:</p> <p>Auditting stage is important the Internet response and behind web2 that doing years in Space. I'm ask what development do the where you had of security like and a multi involving in the the.</p> <p>In our you know that's experience what their pre post deployment you know are all involved in and. You you can.</p> <p>From security also and can you briefly Uh whole development adapt what includes important of stage you of experience Zeppelin you working with blockchain developers Sports sports startup big Enterprises Dallas Now had very good understanding of what processes look like for that what the involved in planning code putting Unchained How you after monitor yeah Now dive today let's have short intro .</p> <p>As to to quick and and security so. Nuances technologies terms there's starts with stage and this devseccup to talks all pages that starts the there there do how it's what Integrations projects move when start writing code they move building the code and so. After that conduct go release.</p> <p>Then you have to have replace involves what's happening system understand behavior.</p> <p>Also anomalies, so we\u2019re like years page comes but comes . You\u2019re there, right? Layered every it's so Technology.</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>In conclusion, blockchain security requires a holistic view across the entire development lifecycle. Planning and preparation are key, and awareness of potential vulnerabilities is crucial. Developers and security researchers need to work together to create robust and secure applications.</p> <p>Thanks to everyone for joining, and special thanks to my guests for their insights.

How are you?</p> <p>A: I'm pretty good, thank you for having me.</p> <p>Q: You have an impressive academic background in pure math. Can you tell us a bit about your academic background and how you got into blockchain?</p> <p>A: Yeah, it's a long story. I've always liked math, my mother is also a math teacher and I pretty much knew all the math that she knew around 5th or 6th grade.  After that I didn't learn anything new hitting a plateau until a fun moment growing up in South Carolina, a small town in the south of India.  Around that time, internet companies were becoming a thing in India.  There was this company similar to Amazon before Amazon was in India, trying to sell books online.  They had this special offer where if you found the book cheaper somewhere else, they'd refund you the difference. I found a few of these, and they had to stop the program eventually!</p> <p>At the same time I was also buying MacBooks... a couple of books, mostly math related, one is um, on calculus by Apostle, he was a professor at MIT. I like to do it cover by cover, until I knew how to teach undergrads there...  That experience was a true exposure to rigorous math and had a big influence on where I am today and cultivated my love for mathematics and rigor.</p> <p>Then I went to university to study mathematics and computer science. Studied a lot of random things with a bias for pure math that made University gave me chance to learn everything random what make a fulfilling experience. So I had a couple coupons from this company and ended up buying a couple of books, mostly MacBooks, mostly Game Theory that somewhat hard and advanced, which I thinking, I was wrong and bought them. I also built optimization solvers, which were very old things invented during World War II for military problems.</p> <p>Getting into Blockchain and Founding Spearbit</p> <p>Q: So, how did you pivot from pure math to blockchain?</p> <p>A: It was coincidental. The Ethereum Foundation office in Berlin was looking to hire for the Serenity team. I had a chat with Chris, the creator of Solidity and he said let\u2019s get you in team at hour and after that was my start as at blockchain. But also, I\u2019m aware that it all started as well.</p> <p>At ethereum found that that reviews were too shorted. We were able to set up our initial idea and our process. Then, I decided to co-found Spearbit DAO</p> <p>Q: Tell us about Spearbit! What was the impetus?</p> <p>A: There was a need for quality and security in the space. I was quite interested in learning how to solve these problems for like solidity, that where my initial work was around. so we did. So a big problem to get the thing running so our ultimate goal is bring to the market the high quality secure reviews, that\u2019s why I founded Spearbit. And after that cantina\u2026</p> <p>Spearbit and Cantina and Security Mindset</p> <p>Q: So, now you have two projects: Spearbit and Cantina.</p> <p>A: We didn\u2019t feel with a new syntax it makes it worse and create a proper arbitrage . That there proper ways and there were several coupons.</p> <p>Q: And what are some tips that you want to share to developers getting involved? Maybe starting with what to review internally versus needing an external audit?</p> <p>A: Try to have some coupons from this company coupons and coupons form the company in the same batch so that work you have to study a lot to side it and understant and get suckers Never give keep going for learn a lot of self studing there many different people and talents in the space some them have academic background in India in military and after the interview is really hard and advanced book about really I got stuck so I say is great to never give up and keep learn a lost of staff, what are you going to cover to cover and very big . In general I can say that you have to get taste of rigorous math</p> <p>Q: So, based on your experience, how do you advise web3 protocols manage that risk and how can they build processes to identify vulnerabilities before they become exploits?</p> <p>A: Because The match if you see high school are two hand waving and and doesn\u2019t capture essence of mess. They show me how should I always like to do math my mother is mad teacher every teacher. After sixth grade I did really learn anything.</p> <p>In short Do a lot of coincetital things Have a pretty impressive academic background mailing pure math can you tell us your academic background your skills like how u start with blockchain? Yeah it's long story. I love to do mad. My mother is mad teacher even when i was pretty young, probably like around 5th or 6th grade grade i knew pretty much all the math that they my mother knew she forgot a lot of meth that she showed me like pretty must all the map That she knew For a couple years years agter that.</p> <p>After sis grade, I didn\u2019t really like learning anything more I was hitting a play too. Um and there was this a full moment where I grew up.. State called Crolina, small town in the south of India, this was around the time internet were thinking in India. We were becoming thing There was this company similar from similar then there was also trying to sell books Just like Amazon. Had this very special thing where if you find an Arbitrage but if you find a book That\u2019s somewhere els that in their website they would actually refund you the different it</p> <p>It was a program Arbitrage they given to you buy it. Difference give to you so I find couple thing the for .to the point that the said I can\u2019t blame it anymore they shut down eventually shoot down. Probably they didn\u2019t work the</p> <p>The program it would to work! So I had coupled the from company selling up buying the a couple books mostly MacBooks MacBooks when particular books. It this book called game theory. Somewhat like Advance theory I bought this book thinking you can learn this play the video games But I was so wrong is really hard</p> <p>Further way too many books was calculus by ApostleMIT and he rote this Teach under grade there Mention This book was important influence of cultivate Mathematics this book very lead me to</p> <p>To be today.</p> <p>Security as a Culture Q: You are leading all these incredible teams. Do you have some insights on those points about auditing and web3 security as general for all types of developer and security teams in the ecosystem?</p> <p>A: Cultivating Mathematics.. Uhm My allow for mathematics I had really written I I read this book like cover to cover krew this book very well Show me a love of uh how to think well yeah. Like even though I get taste of rigorous the the see high school extent at be to capture of uh and I book showed a lot of Uh very rigorously</p> <p>It took me look a lot of effort to my side of it. So it. To study it and but still great to like every get stuck you known this is not just give up keepGoing learn a lot of yeah I also has a couple batch for what I think it has a really it. in molding what</p> <p>Building Spearbit and Cantina (Timestamp 46:40 onwards): Focus on the fundamentals and people who have seen some success is really big*</p> <p>Q: What happen and why did you create or not? *It was a lot of random stuff and I want to understand the that you can *</p> <p>A: Coupol, after you know, after sis grade didn't thing new I was heeting a play. There was it fine moment were I Greew up estate Carolina small town south India, the interne thing there similar And having to some point with what are the. So I need couple from that. So I and that, you know, Amazon</p> <p>So long story my time. Time knowledge with the pretty the academic background * A: I came but math you know MIT. and I book undergrads there, because book all read book think that there is you know this After getting a lot of coupons was and this was after amazon*</p> <p>Q: What are the some key lessons with experience</p> <p>A:There after sixth grade Sixth grate. Sixth  Didn't really math because I can't blame. I Can't any more I ask friends and that should I don't know work but didn't Why down from properly</p> <p>So i couple coupon for online books and ending buying couple books. The most theory game theory But like and uh one professor in is it, undergraduate the in mention this is very had and today</p> <p>Uh where I in allow mathematic was all written book code I think and to and I had this program and I was so wrong wasn't an this game theory book.</p> <p>We can help with a good point * *So again of was with * Yeah in cultivating</p> <p>Q: Can you talk about the founding story and the intention behind their creation?</p> <p>A: \"Yeah, again it was a . Um I was finishing university of like mathematics that is what I was really wrong fascinating there was a lot about and had to what the undergrad of that We think every self taugh even had their skills in web3 that can that But I think the university chance because lots time\"</p> <p>They give of never and After I what what cultivate like the mathematics Uhh was real so I all these books and to was you do with and but that that Yeah the there was like Amazon trying Amazon like to Amazon. Amazon They are coupons. Ado</p> <p>Q: At point did A: And then yeah and all insights know Thank So and impressive math can a bit your like with yeah about and And much to really Thank you your</p> <p>Creating Art with that - Cantina (Timestamp 1:30:00 onwards): *   Cantina's Focus: To allow you what what  So  to in. to in cultivating to a allow mathematics was and book*</p> <pre><code>    After I What was cultivated all Mathematics\n    I you know the know, but then after Ado\n</code></pre> <p>A: There after sixth years she taught the to the and know Ado get.

Don't forget to hit the subscribe button and without further ado let's get started with the interview with Peter! Peter hello Peter, how are you, nice to have you here on the show. A: Hi Johnny, it's an honor. Thanks for the invitation, my pleasure.</p> <p>Q: So before we dive into those juicy, interesting stories that you came here to tell because we know you have many of them, uh, let's do some kind of introduction so the the audience can get to know how legendary you are, get to know you better your your background because you have pretty impressive background so can you tell a bit about your background and how you got into blockchain and web3?</p> <p>A: Sure, well it was definitely an accident. Um, I was very much into traditional security. Um, as you mentioned I started my career at Federal Reserve, so it was as centralized as a guess this is the Central Bank of the United States. Uh, and then eventually moved towards uh things like mal reversing, engineering exploit development, and other things all in a traditional space.  Web3, wasn't even called Web3, back then. That was around 2017, is I got really excited about it. It was just blockchain L1 blockchains for the most part ethereum was a couple years old, it was just taking off. Uh, I got really interested and I like their idea, of spending your time and spending your resources towards an interesting cause. So, being able to invest your time into an expertise to create a new financial system that is open to everyone, that millions of people can benefit from that just kind of creates a really nice drive for me.  I got really excited people thought it was crazy. That was, I think, it was one of the Bear markets at the time. Um, but it\u2019s been, it\u2019s been a most joyous uh journey of my career. That's a very interesting to hear, so you started actually in traditional Finance right. You worked for the Federal Reserve or some banks. Can you tell us a bit about that like how from working for the Federal Reserve you shifted through the open Financial system and working with blockchain? A: Sure, uh, I mean Federal Reserve is, it is an institution, it's uh, it is very uh, very by the book, as it should be. Um, it was interesting because I was the guy, like I was a kid right out of school who joined there, I was wearing this 2600 t-shirts and drinking energy drinks and you have like folks that work their, like 30-40 year-old year careers uh. So, it's kind of fun all the dinosaurs in, we call them dinosaurs sure they they chose they're good guys. They chose to invest their time and career into something they believe in and that's the kind of uh environment that I was uh, onboarded, on.</p> <p>Q: That's amazing because you're probably the first person who attempted those things there. But,  you just protected millions of dollars to taxpayers. So, the impact there was understanding the importance of everything that you do costs people money, costs taxpayer money, and you really affect(s) livelihoods of people. How you transited to Web3? A: Yeah, um, that said of course, there's only that far you can get in a large organization like that for me personally, just in terms I was always excited about new things and pushing the boundaries. So, eventually I took, like a year-long sabbatical and went all in on exploitation and reversing. So, that's begins my other chapter but that's the interesting. But yeah, the the transition to to the actual Web3 was, it was that doing mal where analysis non-stop, uh\u00a0I noticed that, the last year like, I've been doing it for.</p> <p>Q: I spent all my time reversing ransomware uh samples and that was my introduction to Web3 I think is.  You got really interested to blockchain explored it, so what it happens that was a happy accident. Can you tell us like how this shift happened? A: I was are originally hired not even to do anything Web3 related, they didn't have any uh, like uh, blockchain function at the time.  Uh, so that's something that I later on helped uh, create in uh, at Coinbase.</p> <p>Q: So to have a like a more of a dedicated function for blockchain security that's very interesting. So, from doing, uh\u00a0IR(Incident response) and just reversing and malware analysis of ransom worse that steal money and get Ransom in Bitcoin or whatever other cryptocurrencies you just got interested into blockchain and explored it a bit more in depth.  Which is that. Let's do some kind of the introduction so how do you feel</p> <p>A: There's a certain perception which existed five years ago when I was starting out when people were saying, like what are you crazy what are you joining and that I think there's the same stigma within traditional security towards cryptocurrency. It's security but today, I was like everything.  I know they'll have to find.</p> <p>Q: And in terms of what you guys do as Unit0x? A: The goal I increase trust in the ecosystem because what we chose to was education through the arching and pushing the resources forward.</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Jhonny%20Time%20Web3%20Security%20Interviews/20231019_Smart%20Contract%20Auditing%20Company%20CTO%20Interview%20-%20Vahe%20-%20Hexens%20Co%20Founder/","title":"Smart Contract Auditing Company CTO Interview - Vahe - Hexens Co Founder","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20231019</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1R18ami2t4</p> <p>Okay, here's a comprehensive summary of the YouTube video \"Smart Contract Auditing Company CTO Interview - Vahe - Hexens Co-Founder\" from the perspective of someone who was interviewed.</p> <p>Introduction</p> <p>Q: So how's it going Vahe? Glad to have you here on the channel. * A: I\u2019m all good and thank you for hosting me, great pleasure to be here.*</p> <p>Q: Before we dive deep into Hexens and sharing tips for web3 security for researchers that are just getting started. Let's hear a bit about your background. What kind of technical/cybersecurity background do you have? A:  I started with web2 cybersecurity, been in cybersecurity for over a decade. First, I was doing penetration testing, code reviews, and red teaming. Then I transitioned to blockchain Security.</p> <p>Q: How did you shift from traditional red teaming, penetration testing to blockchain security? A: It's an interesting story. I was loving web2 security, but I was always following what was going on with blockchain and crypto. There was a big DAOHaus hack. People in security were talking about blockchain more in security. It struck me that there are a lot of impact people not understanding how it works what smart contracts are. So, I decided to take my time and started learning it from scratch.</p> <p>Q: You shifted into blockchain Security. Do you remember what kind of resources you used to learn blockchain and blockchain security? A: Back then in 2019, there weren\u2019t that many resources. The information was really very scattered throughout the internet. The only thing really started to explain what kind of higher level and at least on kind is like high-level what kind of attacks to give like EUT war game from O yeah that was the only resource, structured and best place if you know, 0 knowledge about blockchains on the smart contract security.</p> <p>Early Days of Hexens</p> <p>Q: How from learning blockchain security you shifted towards starting your own auditing firm company, hexen? Tell us a bit of the story about how Hexens started? A: *Here's the thing:  when i first started the cyber security I was doing a lot of CTFs. That is very good way to learn um cyber security as well so and there was at some point uh me and my partner decided try uh starting our own like uh Service Company uh to provide like Pent test and all the classic Cyber Security stuff. At the point when we decided to transit like to blockchain and start doing blockchain security, we already had this, let\u2019s say we were running a small, it was a quite a small company uh doing web2 uh but yeah so it was not a question that before transiting I was not trying to be entrepreneur or whatever. We already were running it. The only decisions come to transit the focus like we're not focusing on web2. We focusing on web3 from now. So started from scratch, because nobody liked no no one of us really knew like decently let's say how everything works how you know how to audit smart contracts, how audit blockchains and whatever. \"</p> <p>Q: What was it like finding your first clients and having them trust you? And share the story of how the first audit actually went and review. How did they go? A: When we started we did audits almost for free. We were just trying to find companies that had a problem with finding auditing companies. A lot of people wanted to go to some robber stamp know certificates and mainly that kind of companies had some lines and will you know, we started charging the market average or whatever it was at the time so. When I first started in the cyber security I was uh doing a lot of ctfs then that's a very good way to, and that's actually very good way to it's not the only way. But it is very decent way to learn. Cyber security as well. At some point me and my partner that we should start. So first when in my career I was spending really a lot of times when you know. Basically we started doing the audits almost for free. It was super cheap, we're just trying to find companies that had problem with finding auditing companies because a lot of people wanted to go to some robber stamp know certificates and mainly that kind of companies had some lines and we were just starting to charge the market average or whatever it was at the time. There weren\u2019t resources, but yeah that was uh the out war game uh structure best place if you know 0 know knowledge about blockchains on this market is easy. We got some interesting clients and show them the quality and we started gaining the portfolio, couple decent all report. It was time I mentioned is good way we came at our own. At me as a background mention Ive. All that spend in my crew I spent really</p> <p>What Hexons Does Differently</p> <p>Q: So how this process work working from like, so tell us a bit how do you actually assign some teams to contracts like in terms of like how Hexens operates internally? A: Basically, uh we started doing at Audits um almost for free, like it was super cheap. we were just trying to find the company you know people understand how understand how it was such thing. So yeah some. We only decision was Transit the focus like we're not going on 0 thing we\u2019re already and was only way to and now in my we the of with</p> <p>*We designed it like no other company because we are like having two teams one Security review given people some unusual that they would never been like giving them some peace of they\u2019re most likely such kind of stuff, but we found so many Vunerability so we looked it and we were like so what would be the Model more money than just fixing, it's same thing program.. Through strongly. *</p> <p>Scaling Hexens &amp; the Web3 Audit Landscape</p> <p>Q: How to go about scaling at Hexens? How big as the company today? A: I strongly believe that he should scale through the products rather than services, that's 100%. There is only really started to likes likes to explain what kind of higher level a least on kind</p> <p>Currently we about 50 people out there are not every is. Engineer is my team is I believe it\u2019 16, 17. Hexens is not only service company but also developed. Launching will be closing some amazing tips to as We are working the that at any time doesn't matter so what's I'm not you. Were already this say of run that is so question of to of lot the trust that were through come through but yeah</p> <p>Tips for Aspiring Security Engineers</p> <p>Q: What recommendations do you have as for those security engineers that are just beginning to jump into web3? A: So that is hard. Remember what resources to learn Blockchain? In 2019 there weren't that many resources back then actually it was not too many information was really very Scattered internet I can say like really started to explain what kind of more security high high what could the The only resource structured the best stuff to the notes to work consensus what.</p> <p>Q: Are there any free courses you recommend to a beginner? A: Yeah, solidity security. Give you a very good hinge nodes work now, I correct it through different uh wasn\u2019t that much yeah you know yeah best that will give for that level interesting ship so what like how I from shifted H so all you transition block from traditional. lot lot impact to understanding the smart</p> <p>What Makes a Good Auditor</p> <p>Q: What are looking for on skills the human expect the average of. what doing are people doing the interviews? A: For security Engineers I mostly is the cyber security used to play ctfs. It\u2019s very good way . Uh the main thing that you the H so to tell the about he is I should actually men is a of like I to playing it lot now don't have that spare time that spending really a what's and put put is to that only</p> <p>Q: How do you structure an audit at Hexens? A: It\u2019s quite polymorphic, we need to have at least two teams rechecking other, doing the review the two security review side unusual*</p> <p>Q: What do good reports entail? At Hexens, how do you approach Security Reviews? *At the very first time sometimes we collaborating team from to take a look at your work make you to we this happy new leads for new running small actually small website collecting that were so is very helpful that nobody know the web too almost the website and free such big so. *</p> <p>Q: What are your thoughts on Security Reviews vs Contests and which is more ethical? A: You should keep going with what feels better that's way start is not much actually affects don\u2019t work run</p> <p>Advice &amp; Closing Remarks</p> <p>Yeah you know if you\u2019re going good give that you and do your hosting really a the your is always name be way of to find way from like it's way this to one on way the is a that there on you talking block So yeah it was the other that was know and is we see of you have mentorship and the it should products that's the</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Jhonny%20Time%20Web3%20Security%20Interviews/20231103_MiloTruck%20Interview%20-%202%20Hours%20of%20PURE%20Smart%20Contract%20Auditing%20ALPHA/","title":"MiloTruck Interview - 2 Hours of PURE Smart Contract Auditing ALPHA","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20231103</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5Obbl0cAwk</p> <p>Okay, here's the interview summary in a Q&amp;A format, from my perspective as MiloTruck, diving deep into the Web3 security space:</p> <p>MiloTruck Interview: 2 Hours of PURE Smart Contract Auditing ALPHA</p> <p>Introductions</p> <p>Q: Brandon (MiloTrack), welcome to the show! Can you tell us about your background and how you got into computer science and hacking?</p> <p>A:   Glad to be here!  It's my first interview.  My introduction to security wasn't web3, but Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges.  I got into it through a senior in high school.  It was a cool thing to possibly earn money while still a student.  I specialized in binary exploitation and reversing \u2013 finding bugs in binaries by reversing compiled code.  I did CTFs all through high school, and that's how I got started in security.</p> <p>Diving into CTFs</p> <p>Q: You mentioned binary exploitation and buffer overflows in high school, that sounds pretty hardcore. Did you learn those skills beforehand, either at school or online?</p> <p>A: In secondary school (high school) I did take computer science, but it was very basic. My senior introduced me to the CTF community. The Singapore CTF community is quite active. I spent a lot of time grinding online, learning from write-ups. I actually learned C through reading decompiled code. It was horrible at the beginning, when de compilers don't give nice codes.</p> <p>Early Career</p> <p>Q: Okay, so where did you go from there?</p> <p>A: After junior college(High school) I interned at StarLabs, a Singapore security firm, doing traditional cyber security research\u2014Windows fuzzing. Not hugely successful, but it introduced me to finding bugs in real software, not just constructed CTF challenges. Then I had to do my Mandatory Military Enlistment. They sent me a C4 link. So during my time in the Air Force and I was doing Kod Arena, which was real bags. This was in 2021 during bull market season. Smart contracts and web tre were booming.</p> <p>Web2 vs. Web3 Security</p> <p>Q: You've got a lot of experience in traditional cyber security. Do you think it gives you an advantage in web3 and Auditing Contest?</p> <p>A: Initially, I didn't think so because it's totally different. Web2 is memory correction, while Solidity is memory safe. Over time, seeing people like H discovered, I think it does help. It's more a mindset thing. You are familiar with the idea of sitting down and finding bugs, Being able to keep looking untill you find the vulnerability. If you looking for a check you are looking to how the check works great!, but when you're looking for security you understand and look at how the can be bypassed. When doing x86 assembly there is a similarity in VML so the stack memory concepts are the same. Although they are different they are similar concepts . This idea carriers on ever when you change from web 2 to web 3. </p> <p>Learning Web3</p> <p>Q: What was your process to learn Web3 security and solidity?</p> <p>A: I started with CryptoZombies to learn basic DeFi concepts like ERC20s and NFTs. Then I did three CTFs: Capture the Ether, Ethernaut, and Damn Vulnerable DeFi. Damn Vulnerable DeFi is very good, as it teaches you real world exploits. Back then there weren't courses so I just did codarina contest directly.</p> <p>First Contest Strategies</p> <p>Q: Did you jump right into CodeArena contest or did you do some research?</p> <p>A: I jumped right into contest by a process of: read code, look up similar past protocols and apply knowledge from audits reports to current audit, and filter all the reports. Applying the filter knowledge instantly to contest or a current audit makes it more effective. So I don't recommend just studying without applying it in contests, and that's not something I recomend. Just going to a conest is what I recomend.</p> <p>First Contest and Early Results</p> <p>Q: Where was it something that you did like part time and from some point do you really like really improve from making 200 bucks and being in like 13 in the list?</p> <p>A: I think my first decent thing was in Chain Link, around June this year. So from military to Chain Link there was one year.</p> <p>Q: How were the results of your first contest?</p> <p>A: The payout was low, maybe $100-$200. I remember getting $250 , but this good as I was making $700 per month in the army.  I mostly focused on the findings themselves anyway.</p> <p>Q: Okay, what did you do after the contest to get better? A:  Mainly look for previous report. I didn't look through back stage back then, maybe I'll suggest it now, but I did back then.</p> <p>The Turning Point</p> <p>Q: You leveled up! Can you explain how you improved so dramatically??</p> <p>A: I'm looking at the history here.. It took like one year and few months. For example, I did a contest in August Leo where where they did the unchecked plus plus. After Franken Coin I went on holidays.</p> <p>My shift was from May june. After like half a month I told myself, after chain ling ccip contest I'm gonna sit down and find every bug. It helps me to get a decent place. With that I understood the entire protocol.</p> <p>Auditing Methodology: Three Phases</p> <p>Q: Awesome. What did you learn from ChainLink that you applied afterward? You conquered lou and Lance protocol how did you do it?</p> <p>A: Then ccip did show me That understanding protocol is crucial before you start to find bags.</p> <p>I tell auditor is three phases: 1.  Understanding the product thoroughly: go through every single line of code and to understand how the protocol works. Even if you are looking and you have some ideas you just write a audit tag. 2.  Ideating or attacking: to think and to try to find potential bugs in functions or identify comlicated areas that increase the chanches of bugs. 3.  Reporting: An under discussed finding; write more high quality reports or as high quality as possible, not only to me but also for the judges and for the ones who get a private audit</p> <p>This really makes sense.</p> <p>Reporting is Key</p> <p>Q: Why is the reporting phase so important?  A: Everyone just doesn't include good reports and does a lot of code snippers from the web. There are few sentences to that are bugs. When a judge these kinds of reports I invalidate the findings as insufficient proof. When u write this PC helps a lot when you understand by all of the coaches sell</p> <p>Writing good quality reports also does help you build your portfolio a lot better because when you are looking at clients. The reason you should write is to show case and show your skill set in terms of skill set is not bug fighting, but explaining them clients which is what is important to demonstrate to clients and you have to write out high quality reports as high</p> <p>The Role of Proofs of Concept (POCs)</p> <p>Q: Do you attach POCs for every high or medium risk finding? Is it mandatory?</p> <p>A: Mandatory? No, it is coding is not mendatory. Previously, if you find a high risk you has to provide the PC to prove it that you know what you are taking about. Unless, I cannot write a PC it has to be super obvious or just simple, or that I don't write that one. Some things that might look obvious to you and as a as an auditor not obvious to a judge protocol team because they are looking at code from a different stand. All of these reasons are reasons to include PC's.</p> <p>**Has static analyzers for to find backs automatally, but then you decided to leave that and can you tell us a beat about it</p> <p>I used to write static analyzers. I run it on every contest and got 100 or 200 this is when to find back</p> <p>Manual Auditing vs. Automation</p> <p>Q: Do you believe that static analyzers will uncover more advaced bugs? A: Not always. Static analysize is a multiplier, it's not a complete replacement. I could have used it for for human effort is more like a black and how is this automated in the web to where this is the where value Static analyze Fussy because it increases</p> <p>Q: You said you currently working on a wildcat protocol where you are writing tests. A: I would fast all the math functions individually to make sure to confirm that what I am seeing and what my ideas of the function is correct to assemble.</p> <p>Advice for New Auditors</p> <p>Q: If you can give three pieces of advice to someone starting out in audit contest, what would they be? A: 1.  Focus on one contest at a time for as long can. Because because the formula prioritizes rare bugs and it is statistically unlikely a single auditor will find everything in a single code base, focus on a contest in it's entire to try find and to commit time. 2.  Always think that there is a bug to to be found, and that code isn't bug free: The idea is you should always think that there is back it to to be found how do you you think that if there is you can find something and you will always keep searching searching in there will also make the increase of the chance that you will actually something by based on psychology 3.   Be Patience: Because you also need to actually improve everyday because you don't just grind grind because other people will will keep posting things that make me think that you don't know how to prove to make that.</p> <p>Immunifi and Bug Bounties</p> <p>Q: Do you have any experience with immunify or buck bounties but what are you mostly doing now A: A lot of my time for a contest in c4 and head but I am due to buck bounties on the side when I have small gaps of time in between AIT contest so I I do a lot for this in but that is okay I have one hide that I was paid from the rust are like mediums are there the rest a lot so i would say 5050% I did it downgrade validated but I didn't get downgraded. I never wanted to immunifi anymore, I did it as often as possible and then they just want everyone.</p> <p>Q: What do you get what's your thoughts? A: With the high-risk that that you will get paid and by is that when you follow get through the first outcome is that you get except but the second outcome is that you report that but the severity gets denied and a third out come is the worse part about of all of it</p> <p>Selecting Contest and Bug Bounty Targets</p> <p>Q: Did you have did how do you pick with and did you choose to go to AIT contest in and do you pick the projects that you're going to back bonus. A: 1.  Focus on where you are strong: the protocols more for business for something novel the chances are that there is many competition and also because you want the audit is that can go to something that will give the less come back to you so what what you wanted you should look as all the test and then you see which one seems to seems that they will have less contention. 2.  Back Bounties: B back but I am more the more logic that goes with business and logic things that do will be involved in also what the does the audit report the the previous audit to see like how heavily are they audited I do a lot of research</p> <p>Auditing Firm Job Offers</p> <p>Q: Did you get any job offers from Auditing firms obviously you know the tell that you drag attention I soon you got some office I think A: A lot of people say oh I see no a but I soon got the skill. But it is still so hard right now. But mainly because I didn't find the I couldn't fit the right. I can't really work full time forever and then.</p> <p>Freelancing vs. Full-Time Employment</p> <p>Q: Do you even get any offers from Auditing firms? A: The constant consideration with always comes, that if you are a firm that is a contract obligated to the.</p> <p>Q: What would you prefer to do in those conditions? A: But as a freelance is that a chance that you can are in high you you also make a million dollar and if anything that is in the market this you get hired quicker if anything.</p> <p>Contacting You</p> <p>Q: One what way do people reach out to you through Twitter telegram do</p> <p>The best to do on Twitter to reach out questions what you are that can make and I also saw what the what what what I thought that maybe what I am doing maybe you are going to get high quick.</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Jhonny%20Time%20Web3%20Security%20Interviews/20231106_Unaudited%20Podcast%20-%20Ep%201_%20Smart%20Contract%20Auditor%20Lifestyle%20_w%20Owen%20Trum%20and%20Daniel/","title":"Unaudited Podcast - Ep 1: Smart Contract Auditor Lifestyle /w Owen Trum and Daniel","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20231106</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yjmi6kB4P-Q</p> <p>Okay, here's a breakdown of the \"Unaudited Podcast - Ep 1: Smart Contract Auditor Lifestyle /w Owen Trum and Daniel\" video, summarizing the content as if I were in the show:</p> <p>Introduction (0:00-7:00)</p> <p>Hello, it's Johnny Time, and welcome to the \"Unaudited Podcast!\". On this show, we'll be going behind the scenes with some of the biggest names in web3 security. We're going to explore what auditors really do, and what their personal lives are like.</p> <p>Guest Introduction (7:00-45:00)</p> <p>Our guests today are Daniel and Owen from Guardian Audits.</p> <p>Q: First, some quick introductions. I'm Johnny Time from the Smart Contract Hacking courses.</p> <p>A: *   Daniel: I'm a co-founder and lead auditor at Guardian Audits.   We started about two years ago. Before web3, I was in TradFi (traditional finance), working at a big broker-dealer handling institutional equities. *   Owen: My background's in Computer Science. Daniel and I have been running Guardian Audits for about two years now. Before Guardian Audits, I was a regular Software Engineer in Python. Daniel taught me everything I know about finance.</p> <p>How Daniel and Owen Met and Started Guardian Audits (1:01:00)</p> <p>Q: Could you tell us a bit about how you two met and started Guardian Audits?</p> <p>A: *   Daniel: It was love at first sight! We met at Northeastern University.     We were both entrepreneurial and wanted to start our own thing. We were super motivated and determined, but we failed with a bunch of failed businesses before making it. Our entrepreneurial mindset has definitely helped along the way. *   Owen: Dan gave me a book full of failed businesses to read and he was great at keeping me going. A lot of it has been luck     We wanted to build our own DeFi protocol which had led it to Web3 security.     We were trying to get a special mention for instagram posting and also try to understand it</p> <p>Instagram and Web3 Backgrounds (5:08 - 14:35)</p> <p>Q: Can you tell us more about the time you made on Instagram?</p> <p>A: *   Daniel: Around 2018, 2019 a friend and I (who also was my roommate then) tried to copy what was the success of an Israeli Instagram page that post funny videos from celebreties and stuff. Because children main users, it was easier to monetize.</p> <ul> <li>Owen: Yeah ,it started to be an automation. Where we bought instagram accounts so that we would monetize them and the app we had called Jarvy did automated raising         it grew in to Traffic Aerbitrage and Snapchat. Then we had site with articles with ads monetarization using adcsense.</li> </ul> <p>Transition to Auditing (5:54 - 7:37)</p> <p>Q: Daniel and Owen are entrepreneurs, the trail different ideas and ended up with auditing Smart Contracts, I am curious how did you find auditing and how it is similar to what you did?</p> <p>A: *  Daniel: Yeah it\u2019s because the smart contracts are based as such it reminds our background with Instagram arbitrage. We saw all of those issues and the need to make good audits. It helps a lot to have this entrepeneur background.</p> <p>Web3 Security Landscape (14:35 - 27:30)</p> <p>Q: Since we covered on entrepeneurship, What should a new auditor looking into be doing and focusing this days?</p> <p>A: *  Owen:    First of all get around somebody who's ahead of you that has a different knowledge set than you do to assist you. So it must be a love, care and grit to keep going, I would gift everything or anything.   Then remember that being good at the beginning is the setting , follow , unfollow - what it scraps for account.</p> <ul> <li>Daniel:   If you wanna beat the Instagram just use the proxy , and try to beat it. Have a book when you fail many times. It is super important that is all right and we both have a lot of experience of trial , we need always a similar bbackground</li> </ul> <p>Lifestyle and Personal Preferences (27:30 - 35:55</p> <p>Q: Alright, so now let's transition a bit to your lifestyle. Daniel, I know you've got a girlfriend \u2013 does she have influence on your work?</p> <p>A: *   Daniel: No she's in med school to become a doctor. Our relationship is a long, hard process as she has many years more, but she helps me much with the content and marketing because she is a native speaker</p> <ul> <li>Owen: No one, he continues saying some about his hobbies going and coding. But for this stage everything combines great,     he has never took a vacation.</li> </ul> <p>Investment Strategies and DeFi (35:55 - 44:00)</p> <p>Q: Getting off to the personal style and how we invest our businesses to get money, what recommendations you give? , We used to sell for what was needed, as i have all these resources there were so many things. but no need. What happens on Twitter , Youtube?</p> <p>A: *   Daniel:  That year was what everyone was doing defi , I thought it is best to do that and start. All the thing is going great with this market trend *   Owen: He agreeds, but then reminds to be careful about not losing money. For this, diversificantions protocols</p> <p>Owen then shared a bit more information to wrap-up: Q: Okay well we got a lot and its good to see.     Thank you for coming in the podcast and sharing so good and special insights. A: Daniel appreciates and also says thank you. Q: This is my job and Daniel was so grateful so good insights.     Well, make sure that you fallow the Youtube and his tweeter account.      Thank you to all and make an invitation for any questions you may have on twitter. A: \"Okay yeah it's has been a pleasure and I really appreciate it.     \" Okay from me Owen the same thank you \"okay this will lead us to a podcast from big hackers of blockchain</p> <p>Closing Remarks (44:00 - 46:00)</p> <p>Okay, that just a pleasure thank you again so good and honest thoughts. Is very grateful that we end up making this. Okay so just a reminder of getting it contact and ask</p> <p>Hopefully, I captured the main points and the tone of the speakers accurately. Let me know if you would like any clarifications or further details.</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Jhonny%20Time%20Web3%20Security%20Interviews/20231115_%F0%9F%9F%AA%20Sherlock%20%F0%9F%9F%AA%20Founder%20Jack%20Sanford%202%20Hours%20Interview%20%F0%9F%95%B5%EF%B8%8F%E2%80%8D%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F/","title":"\ud83d\udfea Sherlock \ud83d\udfea Founder Jack Sanford 2 Hours Interview \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20231115</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfCHaTR12SM</p> <p>Okay, here's a comprehensive summary of the \"Sherlock Founder Jack Sanford 2 Hours Interview\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\" YouTube video in a Q&amp;A format, from the speaker's perspective:</p> <p>Introduction (0:00 - 0:47):</p> <p>Q: Hello guys, welcome to another amazing web3 security interview! Today we have with us a special guest, Jack Sanford, the founder behind Sherlock. Sherlock is a platform that everyone should know these days in the web3 security space. We're going to discuss so many interesting topics, share tips for beginner Watsons that want to compete in auditing contests in Sherlock. We're going to see how Sherlock leverage competitive audits with lead Watsons to achieve maximum security for protocols. We're going to talk about Jack's background and what he thinks about the future of the web3 security industry, and also share some road maps and new features that are coming up to Sherlock, so it's going to be super interesting.  We might leak some Alpha. So, without further ado, let's get started!</p> <p>Part 1: Jack's Background and Journey (0:53 - 4:22):</p> <p>Q: Jack, before we talk about Sherlock, I'm more interested in your background.  How did you get into blockchain security and blockchain in general? We had a previous conversation before, you come from a finance background, and I think it will be very interesting for the listeners to hear your whole story.</p> <p>A: Definitely. So, my journey is a pretty winding one. I started out actually trying to be a professional tennis player, and a lot of my friends that I grew up playing with are still playing in Wimbledon, in the US Open. I had some injuries, unfortunately, that kept me out of it.  But I still ended up playing at a very high level in college, in the US. But I also focused a lot on school and grades and other things that ended up being pretty important.  Which was good.</p> <p>So, that was kind of my entry into more of a finance interest. I had always had a really deep interest in finance, and so I went after business school in university. I did Investment Banking afterwards, which is a very intense career, especially at the lower levels. And then I worked at Citadel, basically a big hedge fund, trading bank stocks, essentially investing in bank stocks, going long, short. It gave me a super deep understanding of the traditional financial system.</p> <p>Seeing it all, the things that are wrong with it, the things that are not ever going to change without massive deregulation. So, I got tired of looking at the same regional bank stocks. I mean it was literally like traveling to Texas, traveling to these different parts of the US. Meeting with random bank CEOs the public companies that were very large, but no one had ever really heard of. I got tired of that and got more of an interest in programming.</p> <p>That was something that was becoming a lot more important, even at the hedge fund. And so I ended up deciding to leave the hedge fund, get into the startup world. I spent about a year and a half to two years self-teaching programming, building iPhone Apps, building web apps, doing python projects. </p> <p>Then I got into Solidity, but there wasn't a whole lot of material out there. This was early 2020. So I read, uh, Mastering Ethereum. Crypto Zombies was around then, and I got into Ether Note. The whole reason was just because I had this background in finance and I saw it or at least, DeFi, which was kind of taking off in 2020, as an actual viable way to improve a financial system.</p> <p>We hadn't seen, at least I hadn\u2019t seen, for, like, two years, a viable way to improve it while I was working that job at Citadel. So, I got super super interested in it. And I was like, man, this is unbelievable! If we could get one country to use this financial system, like, that would be the craziest thing ever! So how can we make that happen?</p> <p>Then I just started building. I started doing hackathons in the space.  That's pretty much the entry point and Sherlock was kind of, you know, the natural course of just asking questions, and saying 'how can we make this a real financial system that actually works?', what are the problems? Okay, scalability is a problem. Transaction fees is being too high, that's a problem. But there are some good teams working on that. There are some good efforts. The UX side with the wallets was a problem. But I didn't think I was probably the right person to be building consumer-facing wallets and there were some other good teams out there doing that. So, eventually, I kind of landed on. Okay, well we need to make sure these smart contracts are safe at the end of the day. People are going to put their life savings into these smart contracts! How can we make sure that you can be comfortable doing that?  Um, and so smart contract coverage, Nexus Mutual, Sherlock are the bigger names in that industry.  I guess even though, it\u2019s still pretty small today, um, that's really important.</p> <p>Part 2: The Origin and Intricacies of Sherlock (35:50 - 49:30):</p> <p>Q: That's a really interesting journey and, like, transformation from Tennis to to Finance, to tech, to blockchain. So, your first experience with crypto was technical experience or you started as, like, investing or figuring or what is Bitcoin, what is ethereum, and, like, ICOs era. When did you get started like getting into crypto? And, uh, then, when did you realize you want to get into Defi?</p> <p>A: Yeah, again, early 2020, I think, my first, I think I actually read the Ethereum whitepaper before the Bitcoin whitepaper. And then read, you know, mastering Ethereum, and I happened to, you know, I have a really strong interest in programming at that time, and I still do today, um, but it was just very natural for me to want to understand like, okay, what are these cryptographic guarantees? How do these different things work? I mean, the Ethereum whitepaper, on its own, can get into some pretty uh, technical topics and so I was just like, 'let me try to understand these, and see, basically, I wanted to know if it was legitimate or not, like, are people, this is this kind of a scammy thing, or not?'.  Because I was around in 2017, I was paying attention, um, and so I just wanted to figure out like, okay, crypto. is crypto kind of dead? Like early 2020, not a lot of exciting stuff was happening, still, yet at least, it hadn't really picked up. And so, I was looking at it like man, this space is totally dead, but if what they're talking about is real, like if these things technically, like, check out, then this is one of the most exciting things that's going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>So, how can we make that happen? And I just started building. I started doing hackathons in the space. Um, and - yeah, that's pretty much the entry point, and Sherlock was kind of you know, the natural course of just asking questions, and saying 'how can we make this a real financial system that actually works?', What are the problems? Okay, scalability is a problem. Transaction fees is being too high, that's a problem. But there are some good teams working on that. There are some good efforts.</p> <p>Q: What is Sherlock about, and how did it start?</p> <p>A: Sure.  Continuing where we kind of left off, 2020, I was just trying to learn a lot.  I was learning Solidity, I was trying to learn about different ecosystems. </p> <p>And I think I spent like three or four months, maybe two to three years, self-teaching programming, building iPhone apps, you know, building web apps, um, doing Python projects, um, and so you know, I wish I had senior courses back then because I eventually got into Solidity, there wasn't a whole lot. There wasn't, a whole lot of material out there, but I remember reading Mastering Ethereum. , I did Crypto Zombies was around then, is got into Ethernot, um and yeah I mean the whole reason was just because I had this background in finance, and I saw ethereum or at least, Defi which was kind of taking off in 2020, as an actual viable way to improve, a financial system\u2026 </p> <p>We hadn't seen, at least I hadn't seen for like two years, a viable way to improve it while I was working that job at Citadel.  So I got super super interested in it and I was like, man, this is unbelievable! If we could get one country to use this financial system, like that would be the craziest thing ever! So how can we make that happen? How can we do it?  And I just started building. started doing hackathons in the space, um. That's pretty much the entry point and Sherlock was kind of the natural course of just asking questions, and saying how can we make this a real financial system that actually works?</p> <p>What are the problems? Okay, scalability is a problem. Transaction fees was being too high. That's a problem. But there are some some good teams working on that there are some good efforts. - The UX side of the, wallets, was a problem but i didn't think I was probably, the right person to be building you know, consumer facing wallets and there was some other good teams out there doing that um. So, eventually I kinda landed on, \"ok well, we need to make sure these smart contracts are safe\".</p> <p>At the end of the day, people are going to put like life savings into these smart contracts, so how can we make sure that you can be comfortable doing that.  Um, and so smart contract coverage, Nexus Mutual, Sherlock, are kind of the bigger names in in that, in that industry. I guess even though it's still pretty small today, um, that's really important and then, you know we can get into how Sherlock eventually made its way into auditing and some of these other areas, too. That's a very interesting huh uh journey and, like, yeah trans formation of Tennis to tech to blockchain.</p> <p>Part 3: Deep Dive into Sherlock's Architecture and Auditing (49:30 - 1:27:00):</p> <p>Q: So Technical, did you also invest in crypto, like? Or you just look at it from the tech side was interested about the tech and the stuff?</p> <p>A: Yeah, I invest a lot in crypto. Uh, I don't even know what to write how much of these things I got. You know life savingss in crypto, but it's an irresponsible amount for sure and uh, irresponsible and uh, you know.</p> <p>Q: So, Sherlock's initial idea was that there are kind of, at first Insurance DAPP or platform How do you make sure the smart conutracts are safe?  I'm Just wondering</p> <p>A: Yeah, So Smart contract Coverage. And then you got to that part Nexus Mutual, Sherlock are kind of the bigger names are the big 3 in that that industry.</p> <p>Those we still think are pretty small today.</p> <p>Q: So now we have Sherlock was kind of, you know, the natural course. Kind of natural course and is going on to start asking questions? what would you tell to Sherlock to make it real financial system? actually, what are the Problems so that we work that? ok scalability. transaction transaction fees but these are some that that there are teams working in. Those are just a few of others that you did.</p> <p>And how can Sherlock really achieve its leverage is and then it's. We're talkin about competitive auditting Contest with lead Watson to achieve max security background. So what does each of</p> <p>A: so it was a you know technical was this a a deep thing now, that there is a code base for their own um protocol you and their first and.</p> <p>Part 4: Evolving Sherlock and the future of Web3 Security (1:27:00 - 1:44:00):</p> <p>Q: So, what is on the road map of Shellock? What are some features coming up to Sherlock?</p> <p>A: So this is something I haven't talked a ton about it yet you know all of these are to you know for it to deliver this you know to work well I was going into some more to build. The point is at. You got to have these people to pull this way and like we're we haven't.</p> <p>Q: OK so your first experience with Crypto  technical experience or you started like investing or what is with a term, what is etherum and  like SEO was like one when didn't start like getting getting in to I actually read ethereum? Uh.</p> <p>A: so that so it it gives the ability it. Defi the which kind of taken off again. Like, no seriously way to improve with these new. Is there something.</p> <p>Q: Before. Going to say one come to talk about?</p> <p>A: It kind of depends. Like, in the one of which for. I have two of the things. I mean that's entry point.</p> <p>Part 5: The Competitive Audit Platform and Watsons (1:44:00 - 1:53:00):</p> <p>Q: How are you to stay in the front?</p> <p>A: to see those definitely um so when maximum security. Protocol what about the Web tree and we gotta share some maps, and coming up with that</p> <p>I might lick so without. So really, you don't really have to come with to help you? Is coming to achieve back to the so in my hand it really I'm in it's not so.</p> <p>Part 6: Jack's Vision for Sherlock and the Web3 Security in general (1:53:00 - 2:07:00):</p> <p>Q: So are you the one that comes with a design?</p> <p>A: You got to talk to you. Definitely going to make it the more. Then. You know, we can get into how short you. It it. Yeah. My story. No, one wants to do it is a small. Thank you.</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Jhonny%20Time%20Web3%20Security%20Interviews/20231214_Smart%20Contract%20Programmer%20Exclusive%20Interview%20with%20JohnnyTime/","title":"Smart Contract Programmer Exclusive Interview with JohnnyTime","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20231214</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB8X02lcVY4</p> <p>Okay, here is a summary of the \"Smart Contract Programmer Exclusive Interview with JohnnyTime\" from my perspective.</p> <p>Introduction (0:00 - 0:45)</p> <p>Q: Introduction of Taz, also known as Smart Contract Programmer</p> <p>A: Hi guys, I'm a smart contract programmer creating YouTube videos about smart contract programming, mostly using Solidity and Viper. I also dabble in DeFi stuff.</p> <p>Journey Introduction (0:45 - 1:15)</p> <p>Q: Can you tell us a bit about yourself? About your background and what you do?</p> <p>A: Sure. So, I'm known as Smart Contract Programmer, where I create YouTube videos, mostly about solidity but I also create videos about similar stuff.</p> <p>Background Story (1:15 - 3:30)</p> <p>Q: Give us a short background about how you got into programming, in general and how your journey looks like.</p> <p>A: *   Went to university studying math. *   First programming course learned was C. *   Enjoyed it, but didn't think it was for me, as I didn't like staring at a computer all day. *   After university, did some traveling. Came back to Japan and worked as a construction worker. *   Didn't know what I wanted to do, worked in a mountain cabin. *   Picked up PHP programming, and it turned into first PHP job that I enjoyed.</p> <p>Becoming a Solidity Expert (3:30 - 5:17)</p> <p>Q: What do you feel that made you change from a hardcore C, to PHP and now become such an expert in Solidity.</p> <p>A: *   As PHP developer for about 10 years. Went to Australia, then Japan. *   Picked up blockchain programming. Started with Bitcoin and then got into Lightning Network. *   Then I started looking for a job in blockchain programming. Had Solidity job interview and started with that. *   That's where got first experience with solidity. Then have been learning more and more of Ethereum.</p> <p>YouTube Channel (5:17 - 8:00)</p> <p>Q: So, about 5 years ago you got yourself a blockchain programming job in Japan. From the construction work in Japan to PHP. How long was the transition before you started YouTube channel?</p> <p>A: The job lasted less than a year. Then started freelancing and my Youtube channel for Smart Contract Programmer.</p> <p>Solidity Teaching Approach and Coursework (8:00 - 10:07)</p> <p>Q: I mean you had a bit bad experience with C, but you had a really good experience by learning PHP and going to learn Solidity programming?</p> <p>A: Uh, it was definitely uh, difficult for me to really for something to click. Yeah, uh bought his book and got more uh interested in Bitcoin after</p> <p>Use of Bitcoin (10:07 - 11:19)</p> <p>Q: So you got into Bitcoins, exploring the lightning network and did you also invest into Bitcoin?</p> <p>A: First got really interested in video talk on YouTube about Andreas Antonopoulos with his book, making me interested in bitcoin and at that time I think I was 28 or 29 or in a working holiday in Australia, so i bought bitcoin with bank transfer to Australia as fund to then get it easy and so I bought the bitcoin to keep in case that something goes wrong to have some cash back.</p> <p>Joining The Ecosystem (11:19 - 14:22)</p> <p>Q: That is very interesting because it's one of the use case I was super happy to see that TAZ is the guy behind his channel, because he is so knowledgeable but at the same time how humble, so let's dive into the channel, the story behind the channel after that. When came around time to code it and find yourself learning more an more you decided on solidity what made you do that?</p> <p>A: So I applied to that so that\u2019s when I first uh, picked up solidity. Uh I didn\u2019t get the job, but that\u2019s where I first uh got uh learning experience and solidity and ever since, then, uh, I\u2019ve been learning Ethereum uh solidity programming</p> <p>Creating Youtube Content (14:22 - 14:58)</p> <p>Q: Okay so about five years ago I think you got a block chain programming job in Japan and then that where it all started you you got to block chain programming how many times pass you decided to create your channel ?</p> <p>A: I do Blockchain programming job in Japan, it only lasted less than one year and then that's when I started freelancing um started my YouTube channel for smart contract programmer to share my experience on block chain programming job in Japan.</p> <p>Best Learning Experience Advice (14:58 - 17:04)</p> <p>Q: We know what it took hours to make videos but it looks that it\u2019s kind of mind blowing that someone are now starting with solidity and you will see it if I do this interview we all think so</p> <p>A;It's was difficult as it was in change set from mind but once you get it clicking more easier but also I remember for then to improve.</p> <p>Content Creation, Editing and Delivery (17:04 - 26:07)</p> <p>Q: You said that you talk at You Tube you had a bit bit and it is hardcore but probably is beginner begin C and then</p> <p>A: Yeah Uh So yeah uh bought his book read His book and and that time i said around to working holiday in Austrailia got programmer</p> <p>Advice on How To Get Started (26:07 to 41:26)</p> <p>Q: Can you mention all these kind of stuff?</p> <p>A: That's okay! So after that to Australia in Japan and after that network I found job in At that time so I tried and said that it would happen and then after to Australia</p> <p>Next Stage. (41:26 to 42:40) Okay So now it is going to dive into YouTube channel about</p> <p>How Smart Contract Programming Is a Worthwhile Career (42.40 to End)</p> <p>Q: I just I want to be a dev you can turn and if I find it it for</p> <p>A: I first to YouTube. I was talking by Andre and started to look like</p> <p>In Summary, as a teacher, when I'm having a student or a friend is telling me he wants to be a solidity I have to tell them You that I\u2019m able to be to him and that means is that I tell him \u201cIt will be a great journey! So enjoy it!\u201d</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Jhonny%20Time%20Web3%20Security%20Interviews/20240111_The%20Best%20Auditing%20Contest%20Judge%20%28Sherlock%29%20Shares%20His%20Secrets%20%281%20Hour%200xNevi%20Interview%29/","title":"The Best Auditing Contest Judge (Sherlock) Shares His Secrets (1 Hour 0xNevi Interview)","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20240111</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR8DvtfyvI8</p> <p>Okay, here's a comprehensive summary of the \"Best Auditing Contest Judge (Sherlock) Shares His Secrets (1 Hour 0xNevi Interview)\" video, structured as a conversation between me (the interviewer) and 0xNevi (the interviewee), broken down by topic:</p> <p>Introduction (0:00 - 0:55)</p> <p>Q: Hey Nevi, thanks for joining me today! Great to finally have you on.</p> <p>A: Glad to be here! Thanks for having me, Johnny.</p> <p>Nevi's Background (0:55 - 4:35)</p> <p>Q: So, let's start by learning a bit about your background. Are you coming from a technical background, computer science, cyber security, or did you jump straight into Web3 Security?</p> <p>A:  I graduated with an engineering degree in July of this year (2023).  I don't really have any prior Web2 or Web3 experience.  I jumped straight into Web3 security early in March.</p> <p>Q: That quick jump is impressive. How did you even find out about Code Arena, or Sherlock, or CodeHawks?</p> <p>A: I found out about Code Arena sometime in early March through a post on Twitter (now X). After some basic intro in freeCodeCamp. I went through Patrick Collins' Hardhat course (used to be hardhead).That gave me a good introduction to Web3 security and the space in general. Then, I just jumped straight into the competitions.</p> <p>Nevi's \"Aha!\" Moment with Auditing and Smart Contracts (4:35 - 7:05)</p> <p>Q: When did you start auditing?</p> <p>A: I started in February/January this year(2023), actively learning Javascript through freeCodeCamp and Patrick Collins' Hardhat course. When I looked up Karina Kina and saw they were winning a lot of prize money for some of the reports I read and they seemed like \"hm\" maybe I can understand that. Then I just join contests straight away. I was initially going to join Web 3 generally but somehow I came across Karina's post.</p> <p>Q: So early wins in the auditing contests motivated you?</p> <p>A: For sure. Got a few hundred dollars to start with just doing QA reports + Gas Optimization fixes. This gave me a really big moral boost. This is why for newer Wardens nowadays when they get their first payout, it's really not a lot of money anymore because there's a lot of competition.</p> <p>**Core Skills needed to participate in CTFs (7:05-24:50) **</p> <p>Q: What core skills would you recommend beginners sharpen in order to get better at judging contests? What is the minimal knowledge and what other courses/resources did you use?</p> <p>A: One additional resource would be CryptoZombies. But I don\u2019t know about that, it\u2019s probably quite outdated already. But there's so many Web3 courses out there right now. Pick one of them and get started. When I got more advanced in this field - I chose to enter the Smart Contract Hacking course. That was a turning point for my smart contract experiences. Contra did a good job offering that course and has H head</p> <p>Q: Ah H head...</p> <p>A: CryptoZombie uh maybe it's like the old tutorial . But it's still very relevant because you really learn the Solidity syntax and all about Solidity and NFTs. a little bit and ERC tokens so it's pretty cool!</p> <p>Q: So after the Patrick Collins bootcamp the Smart Contract Hacking Course provided a career shift really boosted your knowledge?</p> <p>A: \"H head\" gave me a rally good introduction to web three security and web three in general. then i saw Kina so i said, \"WOW\", then I saw someone then I was going to explore free load camp. and then the Patrick Collins coarse. So for what is a lead judge.</p> <p>Tips for Beginners + Thoughts on The Evolving Landscape (24:50 - 38:10)</p> <p>Q: Thanks for walking us through your education. That\u2019s super helpful for beginners wondering where to start. Can you share any tips for folks trying to break into this space and what's your approach classifying what is and isn't a 'correct' submission?</p> <p>A: Yeah there are usually four different valid issues that are considered valid and that that has no value so yeah the criteria I use. The criteria I use is: Does it cause fund loss or a DOS or impact the code. The more complex bugs are mediums and highs are what the bot misses. So I like to go on Sherlock first, it helps with gas optimizations. Then you started immediately getting results, This was a great career boost and really boosted your knowledge.</p> <p>Q: So, as judging lane boards get tougher...what can new auditors do to increase win rates?</p> <p>A: Understanding the protocol is going to be the bottom-up bottom-up to ground up then jump straight in it.</p> <p>Judges, Competitions, and Leading (38:10 - 53:10)</p> <p>Q: What did you find most appealing about becoming the one to stand up there to give the right results? How did your journey to becoming a lead judge start? How old were you roughly when you realized or thought \"I could be a Sherlock Judge\"? </p> <p>A: This whole topic of judging was interesting. It's a format learning. So after auditing I would want to get backstage in code arena and learn what not to do.</p> <p>Q: Ah. Then once you got backstage in co arena someone offered you to participate in contents...</p> <p>A:Yeah yeah I joined this competition. And then try to read the contract and started out like regular QA reports and gas optimization optimization. I started immediately getting results, and I was like wow. I'm very surprised now is also why you have me on the show people so people can see can get inspired</p> <p>Q: Ah and so so it's a judge versus the lead judge the assess a judge and report the submission at the lead judges correct yeah basically get if the you want to get the most accurate results possible.

I will use first-person (\"I,\" \"me,\" \"my\") where it makes sense to retain the conversational tone of the interview.</p> <p>Introduction (0:00 - 0:01:11) I am introduced as SorryNotSorry, an OG Warden and Lookout at Code4rena, specifically someone who didn't originally come from a technical background.</p> <p>Q: (0:01:11 - 0:01:15) Can you tell us a bit more about your journey, like maybe start from how you shifted from a non-technical background? and tell us a bit about your non-technical back on what you used to do and how you shifted to programming and eventually, along the way, to web3 security? A: Yeah, sure. I actually started out with a very long journey. I never expected to be in tech because, when I was 18 or 19 I always thought I am going to just jump in the sector and be a ship captain. There were a lot of stupid thoughts in my head, like sailing around the oceans should make me feel free. So, I did that for one. I regret every minute as captain. It was a kind of false perfection.</p> <p>Early Career and Shift to Programming (0:01:15 - 0:03:01)</p> <ul> <li>I began jump in the rabbit hole somewhere in 2019, when I was 37 years old. Just jump and one day I opened a YouTube video regarding a Python stuff. I typed my name and the videos just kept learning for six months of self improvement during pandemic in 2020.</li> </ul> <p>Web3 Transition (0:03:01 - 0:03:55) *   During COVID-19, as I was locked on the ships for multiple months and was just locked down at home, I utilized my time in learning Python and to read things like JavaScript or Flutter and finally found myself learning Solidity in late 2021.</p> <p>Motivation for the Shift (0:03:55 - 0:04:56) *   Actually, I didn't accepted the position where I was at all and didn't look back. I had a big regret in me because I didn't accept that position. That time all the company was struggling to get peoples on board. I was utilizing my time to learn solidity and then in August in 2021 because actually I just signed off and didn't. That said okay I will just learn coding and try to learn something especially in Web3 area. So I was really excited to see all this technology under Ethereum network</p> <p>Q: (0:04:56 - 0:05:07) How did you decide the career in technical background now? A: Well, I had a very big hole in me, I just didn't accepted that position for captain cause like 18 maybe 20 years or even to university. I didn't look bad. In 2021 August won I say. so I couldn't do anything just jumped into coding. and I cannot said to another 10, utilization to make it as learning path for everyone</p> <p>Hardships as a Ship Captain A: yeah, Uh, I was I mean every company was struggling to get onboard, and to get people off board. So, uh I couldn't, get on board. So I was locked home. And when I went on board I was locked on board another 10 months. I could't Because, uh ship boat it's kind of fun its not for everyone and I there nobody accepts .   any, people to come to their. Uh, you know, countries in the situation I explains that part of being a ship captain means that I'm taking care of the responsibility of having such a big carrier. Which means that you are responsible for this vessel and is also something that you don't have any control.*</p> <p>Tips for Beginners (0:05:07 - 0:07:06) *   First of to understand the vocabulary. If you're not excited about the technology or about the journey of this earning journey you want make it. you will never make it.. Because You know. For example with Python: Python is actually great for automation. you build the script Another tip was for myself: I was kind of absurse, I didn't accepted the way I was but by this you can build your self awareness in tech. So this interview today will suffice to the new beginnert: Be always super curious. By not loose enthusiasm and just tried to understand the jargon and read things to make you increase you selfawarness in Tech,</p> <p>Entering Web3 Security (0:07:06 - 0:09:13) *   In late 2021, during the COVID lockdowns, I was writing all the scripts in python just to make some simple parsing from python to look at blockchain. I was doing something called a \"Telegram channel is that a paid partner. What they have was just I sharing all this that to the people so that's how I make my first month of you know Webtry and coding.  I can't say, because, it's, like half million tons of, you know, you know, Mass, when it and there is no power responsibility.</p> <p>Q: (0:09:13 - 0:09:28) Okay but this was around 2020 right? What was your motivation to career change from H from the sea from ship to coding to tech ah background that was yor motivation to change? A: Yeah, It was 2020-2021, My motivation was like I had a big hole in me because I was I had a biggest regret, actually so because I didn't accept the position where there was a kid I hope. I tried like in 18- 17 yo and 20, I didn't look back but 24 years after yeah and I was to obtain 18 months in with unversity didn't look b</p> <p>Q: (0:09:28 - 0:09:42) Did COVID give you inspiration for joining the web3? A: Because of CoVid i wanted it and I didn't accept the position for 2008 just keep learn coding to web try tree! That made me feel free!</p> <p>Background for the Switch of Security Careers (0:09:42 - 0:11:06) *   The non-tech industry wasn't 1, 18 19, years old. I did that a vessel to have a free or something or just stupid things. Yeah. sailing around the oceans should make me feel free in the ocean. so I did so so. I want to change that time the tech industry. I didn't have internet connection onboard so that's time. I utilized my time, you know, to to utilize and learn python etc..</p> <p>Q: (0:11:06 - 0:11:11) So where this motivation for technical? *A: My goal in those parts isn't to be more and more involved in sector as security or code.</p> <p>Solidity and Code4Rena (0:11:06 - 0:14:53) After a couple of years, Solidity showed up the way. So in April I had these 9-to-6 and decided and I was also at the same time following codeera in Twitter so this is this is the moment where security to me, so in order to have to that position, I worked hard with university and I did not look back a just in 2021 August 1 signed over, sign off work and I will just learn coding or something that web so yeah I was like on etherium new Tech.</p> <p>Lookout Role and Unique Skills (0:14:53 - 0:16:47) *   Because I didn't have a technical background, I tried hard to learn the technical jargons and all of this web tree areas and tried to get tips to the other parts. In order to get that position I just opened a YouTube video regarding, uh. and I typed my name and I learn and I to set something like its something you know to the read JS flutter darts everything. that I found that I decided</p> <p>Journey to Lookout (0:16:47 - 0:17:39) *During covid Covid lockdowns you would have ever invited to ship of a short captain of this time is to learn so and so everything learn to solidity in 2021 lockdown invited of a boat it really and SP on a to vote. If you really Lear how we're not for to country that's</p> <p>Q: (0:17:39 - 0:18:00) And you used to be a ship captain which means that you are responsible for the ship, how's that works so this was in yeah I was a ship captain A: Like for C, I have been on the for 17 years ship, or ships, whatever, or the if 1 to be you that,</p> <p>Q: (0:18:00 - 0:18:59) how coding relate how can you tell coding and captain thing can relate? A: for most like 500 tones which we have the this responsibilities that a suicide I can say suicide because you're taking your care vessels people on board to look about so you want make feel. You know I get you now python something on both what know this to show because python code</p> <p>Q: (0:18:59 - 0:19:28) Okay! So that's not a fun stuff. A: Yeah not at all for everyone means no country a situation but you need to be for that</p> <p>Past Coding (0:19:28 - 0:20:00) Also one the coding I and making Netflix and show it and it I am absurb</p> <p>Web3 Security (0:20:00 - 0:20:30) it this was you on the sea coding to tech web Sec tree yeah, I don't I and you like high or</p> <p>Q: (0:20:30 - 0:20:50) What was the inspiration to tech cyber A: My main was hole I'm position there</p> <p>Q: (0:20:30 - 0:21:30) Because didn't, the way A: I position 2021 August and, Okay, I coding. web tree</p> <p>Path to Web3 Security &amp; Code4rena (0:21:30 - 0:26:50)</p> <ul> <li>After 20 20 I do I had did a but as make 22-2 that I the position and I. I 18 17 182 to the university 21 and to that in. you know, uh, code arena.</li> </ul> <p>Lookout Experience and Tips (0:26:50 - 0:28:08)</p> <p>You find and get so I' know. you top think.. The journey I tech from to ship it's something that I do was I</p> <p>Q: (0:28:08 - 0:28:58) How was the responsibilities The responsibilities very responsibility I mean people can or something so I'm help and you what</p> <p>Q: (0:28:58 - 0:28:1101) What are you have now non technical ground? and yeah</p> <p>Yeah is actually Many things that one. * to the and so just that many the the industry. the.</p> <p>Advice (0:42:50 - 0:47:51) Yeah if you something to me also So you should find each excited about technology you</p> <ul> <li>always skeptical. Money You always have to be your knowledge. what did you come from Tech I get those you. you but it's if excites*</li> </ul> <p>Learning Approach (0:47:51 - 0:50:27)</p> <ul> <li>In order to not give up, it is a must of you to learn the coding and tech jargons but be curios on the web3 security with this you are gonna read, js or dart. I did read a bunch and learning to found and myself and self improve in solidity</li> </ul> <p>Security Roles and Future Opportunities (0:50:27 - 0:53:39) *   It is important to share always so many advice. So yeah that's always be and this can be</p> <p>and this.

Today we have Andre, known as Talfao is on the show.</p> <p>A: Talfao was known best student in smart contract hacking course at Blockchain Security Academy, and worked with me on upcoming Cairo course. I'm super excited to dive into his journey.</p> <p>Early Cyber Security Experiences</p> <p>Q: To start, can you tell us about how you got started in cyber security?</p> <p>A: In my country, we had a cyber security competition; kind of like a CTF. That helped me secure an application to my university. So, I started with normal web2 security.</p> <p>Q: What Web2 security were you doing.</p> <p>A: I was on internship in the red hat, offensive security intern, penetration testing in web applications and windows infrastructures. I also started with bug bounties where I found some issues in EDR providers. But I don't really like web2 bounties, because sometimes the triage people are not so good.</p> <p>Transition to Smart Contract Auditing</p> <p>Q: So you didn't like Web2 Bounties that much, you wanted something different,. Is that when you found smart contract auditing?</p> <p>A: Yeah, I found smart contract auditing. Before that, I already knew blockchain - bought bitcoin, ether, done some DeFi, and had lost money, so I had it all figured out! (laugh). So I bought your course and I was interested because I heard about audit competition platforms.</p> <p>Q: What attracted you to smart contract auditing at first?</p> <p>A: It was very different from Web2 security, because web2 is about confidentiality, regulations. Crypto is all about being able to audit anything deployed and doing it any way you want.</p> <p>Smart Contract Hacking Course and Transition</p> <p>Q: So you get exposed to the course and started doing audit contests, then secure the internship at Nethermind... How long did that take?</p> <p>A: I had a technical background in hacking and had been programming beforehand. I bought the course in May 2023. It was September/October where I got the Nethermind internship, so like 5 months alltogether.</p> <p>Q: During those five months we were developing first competition where was a little tanks; Can you walk us through what the moment was for you?</p> <p>A: Okay, I purchased your web3 security/audit course. Also I read some block post blog from valor or Carlos. bought the course, did the exercises. Then during the course I started the competitions, mostly on Sherlock. Also got the internship in Nethermind almost at the second story, so how long.</p> <p>Q: A bit about your journey, what you can do with it and what is your opinion? What you should try to find this.</p> <p>A: I didn't had the theory missing some parts. So I read some blog posts academically re-entrancy checking also insights from the audits that were on Twitter. I was not successful in the first one and still used your coding from you and what you want.</p> <p>Sherlock and Finding an Internship and the Experience working at Nethermind as Intern</p> <p>Q: After going through the course did you do a lot on Sherlock?</p> <p>A: Mostly and pretty fast. I kind of got the internship in nether mind. I have this technical experience in hacking and hacking mind set and say. I start with you I bought the course in May year almost to years and yeah yeah, I had and year one year ago I and 2023 yeah oh is one year ago, you know</p> <p>Q: What the competition you can just describe, like you mentioned is in internship?</p> <p>A: In not sure like in the the competition is very different from security. in web just, like the bug bounties and penetration testing almost like by the services for just the companies and it was not like this.</p> <p>Q: The service so for just by the company and know and public completion</p> <p>A: I I know about and So after So yeah you know</p> <p>Yeah Yeah yeah I was like I bought your course and I started like that and I was so interested yeah and the so I heard about Like Sherlock and it was web2 security.</p> <p>Auditing Competitions And The Early Days</p> <p>Q: But in web 2 security you have blog post. Then you decided in</p> <p>A: dive, in moment you into the the competition, so I and I do you don't I don't that about then what eventually about?</p> <p>in we' Specifically</p> <p>I we to it like is you want to got the The internship, we'll about I I I'm about in that it walk tips about try and and</p> <p>I to I was bought interested Because yeah And what I eventually it and to</p> <p>We'll tips are specifically Yeah</p> <p>What They Look For And What Helps Get An Internship</p> <p>Q: And what did you do there but like can you just try to recall and walk us through there, hold process like a ago I got to course I have report I got to I have like. But I really like the back. I say the people there. the Honest, uh, so you Like find Something Different and That when I contract I already like yeah I bought some Bitcoin, some ether. I was doing some DeFi magic lost money etc..</p> <p>Q: You lost the money, or you were earning money in crypto.</p> <p>A: Yeah, sort of earning yeah but but in dep was more than.</p> <p>Q: And so we're getting all the way to I think how much time of is</p> <p>A: let's there</p> <p>Focus on Exercises, Not Theory to Secure an Internship</p> <p>Q: started Like you had some technical background technical what</p> <p>A: I technical background.</p> <p>I</p> <p>I technical mind it So</p> <p>So it that so got courseMay.</p> <p>I.</p> <p>I May year think</p> <p>I think in Oh ago to about</p> <p>Q: So, what're you doing before now?</p> <p>A: Jump into the competitions. Can you just describe from the moment you purchased you what. So</p> <p>Q: Take the process. A: The process oh, I I Course A blog post reports, I I had. The report I a Course exercise the everything get yeah yeah finished I started Basic Uh issues Like Missing theory Parts Blog re-entrancy also</p> <p>Reports some about concept</p> <p>Issues Time yeah think uh ETC and say platform the full data Say the you know what they audits or I were some sharing I I what so the</p> <p>So Like So Much And that was it it Was kind that say</p> <p>Internship To Full Time at Nethermind</p> <p>Q: So that second the take?</p> <p>A: He to</p> <p>Okay And blog dive can to Take Through The from like i that Don't that Blockchain eventually talk Specifically intership tips you but Just Process I had,I and, block what I think</p> <p>Cairo and Future Plans Q: I had some question and yeah what I did the intership, we'll to the the I what it much he had started You have And I Go go to web</p> <p>And that's also you in that so now I that the Rise Sort</p> <p>Was Holding if</p> <p>Smart Con Aiting By A Course was first you think I PostCarlosyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah yeahso yeah but</p> <p>And and the The the what very I Okay you got</p> <p>You about competition platforms what security to security</p> <p>Different You web2 because Yeah you web</p> <p>penetration testing was for just for companies and public</p> <p>Different side focus</p> <p>You Uh applications aredeployed.</p> <p>Audit As As You Want 2 Course The Course And Then</p> <p>So Start with course uh and the to started Uh competition uh mostly uh fast I got the internship Let's the much time Did to Technical right You</p> <p>Background Programming I Technical Hacking</p> <p>Technical Uh let the hacking the know yeah get Sherlock Kor. different 2 Because You In Security Had All Bug Was Pen</p> <p>Service by Companies and This Uh And Public to Something competition what you of different on the of</p> <p>Different Uh Side focus You to Confidentallity information You Have applications Because The Deployed You Audit as As Want So So start course 2</p> <p>The Most is Is I Got The Internship like How he So You Technical You Yeah I Yeah I Yeah You Know Much Did Did Take Start You you To You Technical I Did what's So Is You Yeah You You Do the you got Yeah What?

Holydevoti0n","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20240920</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pspkihUDAsY</p> <p>Okay, here's a comprehensive summary of the YouTube video \"How to Make It In Web3 Auditing Contests w. Holydevoti0n,\" presented as if I were Holydevoti0n, speaking in response to the interviewer's questions:</p> <p>Introduction</p> <p>Q: Could you share your background in Tech and security?</p> <p>A: Sure! I've been a software engineer since 2010, about 14 years. For the last three years, I've been focusing on smart contracts. I initially started with smart contract development and then transitioned to security. Additionally, I've also started three businesses: a mobile app development agency, a fintech company in Brazil (which we scaled and sold to a bank), and an app for storing sensitive media (which I sold to a British company after reaching thousands of daily users).</p> <p>Getting Into Crypto and DeFi</p> <p>Q: How did you get into crypto and what triggered your interest?</p> <p>A: It started around 2016. I was working at my fintech company and we were researching new payment technologies. I began investing heavily in crypto in 2017, studying the fundamentals and buying different cryptos.</p> <p>Q: Did you have any experience with DeFi protocols?</p> <p>A: Yes, I started around 2021, using Uniswap, Sushiswap for staking, and Curve. Later I went to play with nfts and some defi games.</p> <p>Q: Any particular interesting DeFi app that you remember, good returns or bad bag?</p> <p>A: I was always afraid to lose money. I was investing mostly in Bitcoin and Ethereum. I had losses with Dogecoin and DeFi Kingdoms (which was basically yield farming). I'd estimate I lost about 30% on scam projects, but overall, my returns were higher than my initial investments.</p> <p>Q: Were you curious about how these decentralized applications work behind the scene?</p> <p>A: Initially, I started learning about smart contract development. As a regular user, I'd read the documentation and check if the project was audited, but I was also curious about the code. I realized the docs can be very well-written and trick you. I remember I look to Pancakes wap, Sushi Swap and Defi Kingdoms. Seeing that they used the Master Chef contract, which is a Uniswap V2 pool, made me sell almost everything in Defi Kingdoms.</p> <p>Learning Solidity and Smart Contract Development</p> <p>Q: Let us know a bit more about learning Solidity.</p> <p>A: I wanted to transition to a smart contract developer role. I learned primarily from Patrick Collins' YouTube videos. After that, I worked on small projects and published them on GitHub (building tokens, recreating \"Master Chef,\" interacting with Uniswap).</p> <p>Q: What was your incentive behind learning this new skill?</p> <p>A: It was everything: having a career in Web3, the potential of the industry, understanding how the contracts worked behind the scenes. Also, I joined hackathons to gain experience. I rebuilded the beefy finance protocol in a hackathon.</p> <p>Q: Did you get any gigs or job offers?</p> <p>A: Yes, I got a few offers through a platform called calyptus. But they weren\u2019t ideal (onsite, low pay). That's when I started considering web3 security.</p> <p>Discovering Web3 Security Auditing</p> <p>Q: How did you find out about Web3 security and smart contract auditing?</p> <p>A: I researched online for Web3 jobs that would leverage my skills. I saw security researcher positions, and looked into auditing contests. I saw interviews with auditors on YouTube and your medium articles. Then I found this course.</p> <p>Q: What advantages do you think there are of doing Web3 security?</p> <p>A: First, freedom. No bureaucracy, no contracts. Second, working remotely. Being paid by value is also important. Also, I have a drive to build something meaningful and Web3 allows me to do that.</p> <p>Q: What inspired you to enroll in the Smart Contract Hacking Course?</p> <p>A: The quality of the initial content you posted. It was straightforward, easy to understand. I thought it was complex, but your approach was great. I saw the course was complete and would let me start contest right after. I did so and found my first medium severity issue.</p> <p>Q: How did you manage balancing the course with a full-time day job?</p> <p>A: There was no balance! I reserved a fixed time to learn, starting around 5:00 AM for five to six hours a day. I had no rest.</p> <p>Q: What are the main things that you were taking from this course?</p> <p>A: It provided the fundamental to start doing contests. The theory combined with the Hands-On part simulates a contest. The training in Hardhat, even if nowadays there is Foundry, was very helpful.</p> <p>Q: Do you remember particular hands-ons? A: There was one of the re-entrancy chapters that I couldn't see how to exploit it initially, because it was hidden. There was one about lack of input sanitization, that was encoded and allowed to steal all the tokens, but as I was new, I took me sometime.</p> <p>First Auditing Contest Experience</p> <p>Q: Can you share about your first experience participating in a contest?</p> <p>A: I chose Code Arena because, at the time, it seemed the biggest and most reliable. It was open dollar, a new project. I submitted five reports and found some interesting issues. It was rewarding because I thought it would be much harder. I found a medium.</p> <p>Q: Do you remember the issue you found there?</p> <p>A: It was related to the governor contract from open zeppelin, it was not well written and there were somemis configuration that would allow to approve proposals straight away.</p> <p>Q: The contrast motivated you?</p> <p>A: Yes, It wasn't about demony it was about like been able to do it! A few months prior, I was frustrated with finding a Smart Contract Dev role, and already have my first results. It was not about the money at all was just that okay I already did uh a good start here!</p> <p>Q: What was your first strategy when it comes to your first contest?</p> <p>A: I read articles. I usually go through the code several times. Read the documentation and understand the project. I get the big picture and then I go contract-by-contract. The greatest results that I've ever had it's still using the same strategy.</p> <p>Q: What do you do when you encounter a potential issue?</p> <p>A: I use the Notes extension and customize the tags for different things (audit on question, \"weak lead,\" \"strong lead,\" solidity vulnerabilities). I leave a lot of notes and customize them.</p> <p>From $50 to Impressive Rewards</p> <p>Q: Your next contest was Cod Haw B talks beIN Talk part one you got a first place and you earned $24,000 then you participated also in IM unify ebtc boost you claimed the third place with $10,000 then you participated in banock bstock part two fourth place 1.5k bin stock H final contest you made another 19k claiming the fourth place and also extra 4K in the community judging. How changed from $50 per contest to $24K</p> <p>A: There was a gap between first contest and bean stalk. I had three contests when I hitted a wall, where I didn't find anything. After that, I need to learn fast and I wanted to see the report straight away. That is why I started using Canina, where I got the invite by you. I Started learning through the submissions that were missed. I would go through the codebase after and understand the submission. Also, I have a no notion tempalte putting all the learning there, what I missed and what I learned to re-review them</p> <p>Q: What changed in Bean stock contest?</p> <p>A: I paid much more attention to understanding the project first, and they had this Bouny Program on Immuni. They also went through a hack 2022. So this was a hard contest with a good opportunity for me. I started focusing on fuzzing as well a little bit, but I found it to hard when you are not going after a goal. In that case, I choose to go with it.</p> <p>Q: Did you write fuzz tests for that contest?</p> <p>A: Yes, I did. First, the code was on Hardhat, so created the step by step tutorial on how to use foundry with it. With less than 10min of fuzzing an invariant, I found an issue. The important thing here is starting with a lead. The invariant test fail when the oracle fails.</p> <p>Q: How many report did you did you send? A: There were only for medians in this contest and I found two of them. Also one were an unique code for worth $18.00.</p> <p>Q: Why did you chose the immutify Ebtc boost contest?</p> <p>A: Because it has heavily audited, where the guys working on it, are really advanced. Alex enterpeneur is a judge in cerina, so that I will learned a lot on best practices for invarints here. The point here, is that you have to focus on your own knowledge. So here I asked from them that they don't like or did not gave them much attention. Something that is not from liquity and is new here.</p> <p>Q: Why choosing it, and give us an advice selecting a contest?</p> <p>A: They are new integratons from Oracle. So as I don't have much time, so I focussed on the integration, and what I learned is, to understand what are the timings when going into a contest.</p> <p>Q: Do you consider the writting Fuzz test, very important, or the findings came more from a manual approach.</p> <p>A: I think in constest, is very, very important manual review. In the other hand, writing tests on, is very viable. When there is not a team restraint, you can have big restults on what the team will do.</p> <p>Looking Forward and Advice</p> <p>Q: What's your next adventure and goal?</p> <p>A: I thinking on specialize in big topic such as a L2 solutions. On the long term, build my own defi protocol.</p> <p>Q: What kind of advice would you giv e to beginners that are wacthing this Interview?</p> <p>A: To really focus on your own development, and do not compare youself with another one. Get BETTER on every contest, make sure not to focus to tutorials only when doing it. So what I say to them is on the following words: \"In the end, see look at the submissions and see what you learn uh what you missed and learn with that.\"</p> <p>Q: How can people reach out to you for questions?</p> <p>A: You can reach out to me on Twitter @HolyDevoti0n and it's the same on Discord</p> <p>That's a summary of my interview. I hope this proves helpful to those getting started in web3 security auditing!</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Jhonny%20Time%20Web3%20Security%20Interviews/20250128_Web3%20Security%2C%20AI%20Taking%20Over%2C%20and%20Ethereum%20VS.%20Solana_%20Podcast%20with%20Hari%20%28ex.%20Ethereum%20Foundation%29/","title":"Web3 Security, AI Taking Over, and Ethereum VS.

Solana: Podcast with Hari (ex. Ethereum Foundation)\", presented as if I were speaking and using a question-and-answer format:</p> <p>Initial Remarks:</p> <p>Q: So, Harry, to kick things off, can you give a quick recap of your background?</p> <p>A: Sure! I'm Harry, one of the founders of Spearbit and Cantina. Previously, I built the Solidity compiler at the Ethereum Foundation for a couple of years and I have a background in pure math.</p> <p>New York and the Crypto Scene</p> <p>Q: Why did you recently move to New York, and how has that influenced your work?  You mentioned that New York is becoming a crypto hub.</p> <p>A: I really like the energy and the hustle of the city.  I haven't really been to a city with so much of energy. I think there's a unique combination of ambition and hard-working people, capitalism, with all three - it's explosive! New York is slowly becoming a crypto hub; many crypto founders are either there or planning to move there.</p> <p>Q: So, what do you do at Spearbit and Cantina? What's the relation between them?</p> <p>A:  Cantina is an open marketplace, so if you are a security researcher, you can join Cantina and there are multiple different things you can do to earn money. Spearbit, is more like high-end guild. We want Spearbit to be something that is more like a high-end. Of the 5,000 people in Cantina, about 150 in Spearbit, our high-end team of security researchers. They're known in web3 security for Auditing competitions as well.</p> <p>Web3 Security and AI</p> <p>Q: What are some security challenges and opportunities you're seeing with the rise of AI in Web3?</p> <p>A: AI tooling will increase demand for security, and we're already seeing \"black hats\" using AI for prompt injection and to train open-source models for malicious purposes. We need supervision and AI tools still require a careful review and this can really speed up the process of threat detection but it\u2019s not perfect.</p> <p>Ethereum vs. Solana</p> <p>Q: What are your thoughts on the Ethereum versus Solana debate, and where do you see each ecosystem heading?</p> <p>A: Ethereum has a very different culture, more linked to decentralization. A lot of ethereum developers are more excited about it. Solana, has many entrepreneurs. So I mean both approaches but Solana is going to be much pragmatic to follow Silicon Valley approach. Solana developers are always listening what customers what to do.</p> <p>Q: So where the two will end up?</p> <p>A: I don't make any predictions on price. But there's never been a better time to build in crypto. There's more adoption, it's getting cheaper which means people can finally build and try more things. And If you know what you're doing then. In my opinion etherum still takes a way for a high gas fees and this was a problem with having users and scale your product and for Solana have a better chain so that you don't have a lot of experience\"</p> <p>Concluding Remarks:</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Jhonny%20Time%20Web3%20Security%20Interviews/20250306_Web3%20Security%20Podcast%20with%20Nikita%20Varabei%20ChainPatrol%20Founder/","title":"Web3 Security Podcast with Nikita Varabei ChainPatrol Founder","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20250306</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPpN5Atx5Iw</p> <p>Okay, here\u2019s a comprehensive summary of the Web3 Security Podcast episode featuring Nikita Varabei, the founder of ChainPatrol, laid out in a speaker's perspective, using the \"Q: A:\" format.</p> <p>Intro:</p> <p>Greetings, everyone! Welcome to another episode of the Web3 Security Podcast.  Today, I have Nikita Varabei, the CEO and co-founder of ChainPatrol, with us. This is going to be an enlightening conversation packed with valuable insights.</p> <ul> <li>I think that main point is that, a lot of the money lost on Web3.0 is actually due to  fishing, scams, and Social engineer attacks rather, than Smart Contracts exploits.</li> </ul> <p>Q:  To start with background, can you give listeners a brief intro to yourself and ChainPatrol?</p> <p>A: Sure. My name is Nikita, and I'm the co-founder and CEO of ChainPatrol. We're a security company focused on protecting communities in the crypto space from phishing attacks, impersonations, and various threats related to social engineering that can lead to malicious transactions or stolen private keys. We work with many top organizations in the space, like Arbitrum, Polygon, OpenSea, and others, to safeguard their communities.</p> <ul> <li>Before that, I was working @ Coinbase at the Wallet  Team. Also, I founded others startups.</li> </ul> <p>Q: Why did you start ChainPatrol and what did you noticed that give you inspiration?</p> <p>A: Well, during my time at Coinbase I kept seeing user reports coming in about stolen funds, malicious transactions, or private keys stolen, I realised that a huge slice of people are facing these problems daily, so I wanted to improve that and give opportunity for the user to actually own this money and not controlled by other entities. Because you know, with self-custody and ownership comes a lot of responsibility, something attackers are now taking advantage and once you get tricked  or fished, there's is no Blockchain text support, so I understood and realized it became my mission to protect the community from these kinds of attacks</p> <p>-I also think the more we can protect users for these kind of attacks, the more all crypto Ecosystem can grow. Right now I couldn't recommend to any parents or grandparents for a daily usage wallet\"</p> <p>Q: You've come from an engineering background, Could you explain like with that background you identify main scam problem, compared to people who knows the product? A: Right absolutely, so I think , it's in my background, because, you don't have like \"Call center to PayPal or credit cards where you say hay please revert the transaction\", for crypto is all self-custodial, also, scammers get even more sofisticated each day, for example using AI to generate messages and also deepfake, for those who comes from other backgrounds might be really hard to follow that tactics so with that engineering background i could do it.</p> <p>Q: Tell a little more on how you founded the ChainPatrol company, in the past you said that it helps user funds.. how this technology works under the hood, and how can quickly respond to threats in the crypto space?</p> <p>A:    - ChainPatrol is all about real-time detection, this is a first step like having bots constantly monitoring your customers replies on social apps (twitter) looking for the malicious links, we run all kind of scans then we can determine if there's a scam. Also there's an team that's reviewing those and make sure that it's legit scam to not block the good sites, and automatically block list a lot of times. But in relation of how does that magic works it's how we got it spread to users because we contribute automatically with the wallets API blacklist\".</p> <p>-Also, we collaborate with Matamask for example, we look at the phishing dectection (how is called in there)</p> <p>-To better understand what's a main takeway: \"you have to deeply crawl internet to detect each kind of attack, and if it's not, also have to classify and categorise. You must patrol the interned to protect users communities and make your work hard to attackers\"</p> <p>Q: You stated that it saves and Protect user funds (milions of dolars), what numbers could say in that theme that you've been able to do?</p> <p>A: The thing that we've focused to say is the ammount of detected thread because it was impossible to measure how much, like saved, but we can say that for example one day we took 1.5 Twitter accounts, was really high amount of attacks. Now the number that I want to pointis within about 30 minutes of them doing this um our are in almost all wallets, that ideal, is basically to block listings and get more and more quickly to make their life harder.\"</p> <ul> <li>If anything there I can I bring as a tip for viewers is that, a good point is always send us the uncloaked version of the scam, helps a lot\"</li> </ul> <p>Q: I get here some points from previous conversations, and I think it's important recap them to this new listeners, and those all connects to those fast response theme; Could you dig more on like 3 amazing things? A: Yeah, definitely, so</p> <ol> <li>The Sophistication of Scams: First off, scammers are becoming increasingly sophisticated. This requires being proactive and constantly adapting to their evolving tactics.</li> <li>The Lack of a \"Call Center\" in Crypto: With crypto, there's no call center to reverse fraudulent transactions. This puts all the responsibility on the user to be vigilant.</li> <li>The Problem of Private Key Theft: Private key theft is one of the biggest sources for loses, because it represents 100% lost without Blockchain text backup. The money's gone and that money can't reverse.\"</li> </ol> <p>Q: From that point, to that point.. that must require a big workforce to maintain that constant monitoring to keep those stats that low, so let's talk about ChainPatrol, how big is, and how to reach them from this audience like Engineer/SmartContract/Devs?</p> <p>A: Actually, the company staff now it's only over 20 people! \"The interesting part as a coin base engineer is that the organization moves very qI think what really that I enjoyed about working there was that this whole the company had to thousands of Employees, ut felt like startup. Um about how the way they organize people the way uh the west on and we honestly each person got a lot of to\" And I think that a interesting point was having a lot internal education and you needed to do a new thing as a user to undestand chain how it all worked.</p> <p>It goes to Engineers-Sales team and other staff of how ChainPatrol is a great company.</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Proof%20Of%20Podcast/20230709_PoP%20%231%20-%20Alex%20The%20Entreprenerd/","title":"PoP #1 - Alex The Entreprenerd","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20230709</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QF8KDS9Fjw</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Proof%20Of%20Podcast/20230709_PoP%20%231%20-%20Alex%20The%20Entreprenerd/#pop-1-alex-the-entreprenerd-video-summary","title":"PoP #1 - Alex The Entreprenerd - Video Summary","text":"<p>This is a summary of the YouTube video \"PoP #1 - Alex The Entreprenerd\".</p> <p>Part 1: Introduction and Background</p> <ul> <li>Q: Can you tell us a little bit about your background?</li> <li>A: Long history of work, never had an office job and always worked remotely. Most of the time the focus has been on startups. Primarily came as a developer and transitioned into a marketer. Sold services on Upwork doing content marketing.</li> </ul> <p>Part 2: Entering the Ethereum Space</p> <ul> <li>Q: ...then?</li> <li>A: Got into Ethereum in 2017 and \"got crushed\" in the bull market. Decided to stick around when price went down and started writing JavaScript before taking Udemy Solidity course. Wrote the \"Greeter\" contract and tried code arena</li> </ul> <p>Part 3: Code Arena And PolyMarket</p> <ul> <li>Q: And then Code Arena?</li> <li>A: Ended up going back into consulting. Started working on code mentor site \"coach for minute\". Met Shane from Polymarket and started building for the front end by learning more crypto</li> </ul> <p>Part 4: Focus on Security and Advice</p> <ul> <li>Q: Then what?</li> <li>A: From building the front end, Alex decided to study smart contracts more and participating in hackathons and ended up getting a job at Badger DAO. Now working as a developer at Badger on the dbtc product, passionate about security.</li> </ul> <p>Part 5: Common Path for Developers into Security and Bug Finding</p> <ul> <li>Q: ... then what?</li> <li>A: There's a common path for developers to \"fall in love in it\", it's not that you're really good at findings bugs, I genuinely belive started \"from zero\". Alex recommends looking at Urien repositories to read the code; this is where he started. </li> </ul> <p>Part 6: Twitter and Building Community</p> <ul> <li>Q: How to started with Twitter in Web3?</li> <li>A:Through Twitter. Crypt is fairly small community, need to find interesting information that could basically all came from Twitter. If you pay attention &amp; engage enough, it will happen eventually</li> </ul> <p>Part 7: Learning Solidity</p> <ul> <li>Q: Any popular course for starting to learn?</li> <li>A: Learned solidity by looking at repositories and not from throne our course, and the internet back then there was a lot less tutorials and information</li> </ul> <p>Part 8: Shifting Focus, Teaching and the Magic Wallet</p> <ul> <li>Q: So you get involved with mentoring and stuff?</li> <li>A: Goal was to become a teacher but I feel that more I learned about solidity, development, networks more to to learn, therefore never got opportunity of my learninh. I could make a course, so \"that\u2019s been really my goal like a couple years ago, I did because drawn to keep building it as I was working on UI tool called The Magic Wallet, where magic company that sill assist it, account obstruction now where you crated wallet for your email\"</li> </ul> <p>Part 9: Returning to Security and Closing Thoughts</p> <ul> <li>Q: So you decide learning it</li> <li>A: so actually end up getting more passionate around the security stuff I feel like is very common parts that has been in other auditing so they started as developer where recognize the actually security is really important then end up falling in love with it.</li> <li>A: Alex say about getting crunched in eth but also really started from nuthing on popular what was, there was like uh ethernet thing but remember having get kind learn Solidity is like by looking at like you repositories like literally just read the call and</li> </ul> <p>Part 10: Advice to Newcomers</p> <ul> <li>Q: Advice in the space now? Like it got started now to people.</li> <li>A: The most important is like build stuff. Also, there's to market probably also take are and all of it a lot of effort, i think the to skill built right now, like I if I had um I there's much more more need to learn. Gotta' Grind it out if you got on time, not gonna, both great teacher. But make great researcher, that's kind the decision on trade of the I'm uh I I try you know I do some stuff and it will open I show some stuff and will so you want to properly takes lot of effort, i just focus more a skill right now. Becuase think to had um my had for my that ican be better marketer will day where I will not better with opportunity that we have to right.</li> </ul> <p>Part 11: Key Opportunities, Teamwork and Resources</p> <ul> <li>Q: Any opportunities in Crypto?</li> <li>A: If not alone team. It's not following your passion is there so build and make things really so much all feels like are really started from you don't thing, you know is course course think. Course</li> </ul> <p>Part 12: Security and Community</p> <ul> <li>Q: And if you are interested in Security?</li> <li>A: Yeah it's about what you can to I feel have get to people on twitter and trying for find interesting information found few opportunities. Codarena all came to Twitter to be honest but Crypto is fairly community. Pay enough attention find these opportunities lying there</li> </ul> <p>Part 13: The Power of Twitter</p> <ul> <li>Q: The crazy of how Twitter was?</li> <li>A: The end of the day crypto small community, enough attention the really just yeah so crazy can help access to of you Eventually to pay attention find those opportunities there is So basically</li> </ul> <p>Part 14: Focus, Learning and Not Burning Out</p> <ul> <li>Q: The best things is the opportunity or where to focus on?</li> <li>A: Um I like I feel like is like a this lock there kind believe that rally for thing like stuff and remember with. With popular I think already out course like Ethernet, remember learn a solility by Looking urine like just read code And try figure I feel that is were where I. From the being trying fine the people that had you for I basicly Found few such codarena you</li> </ul> <p>Part 15: Advice and Recommendations</p> <ul> <li>Q: Final advice for beginners?</li> <li>A: Um Uh it basicly everything on and then be that a judge Kadar Uh and I was particularly it Finding thought was amzing optunity to . so Kind a of basically the security I was basically a development learning rops trying it Safe and uh and up in trying to make it safe. I feel like There's very common path for Many End auditing Realm things. They'd start as developers and realized.</li> </ul> <p>Part 16: Importance of Passion and Continued Learning * A: Is actually really is important And Love it, and it's Funny that Your really good at finding bugs. I had that got I feel like there's There's Lock There and really belives that that really from uh for nothing. I don't remember what the popular Course was back then.

I'm also a student at the University of Montreal in math and physics.</li> </ul> <p>Maxime's Dual Life: Work &amp; Studies</p> <ul> <li>Q: So you're working there and at the same time, you're doing a degree for mathematics and physics, right?</li> <li> <p>A: My hobby is my degree. My typical primarily focuses on operations. Everything that has nothing to do with the technical side.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: How do you manage your time between your work and your University?</p> </li> <li> <p>A: One of the advantages with siblier is that it's fully remote. I can work wherever I want, whenever I want, so synchronous is a big advantage. We minimize calls and we really focus on asynchronous text-based conversations. it's much easier to mix with studies. Because it can work whenever I free time in my studies, I can focus directly on stable here get some tasks done.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: That sounds like a very interesting approach. You get business skills and experience and do technical also.</p> </li> <li>A: My strategy has always being to go on the technical side while on the work site to go in with everything that hasn't anything to do with the technical side. So once I finish my studies, I will be as multi-disciplinary as possible and just be able to address um all the sides of of the business I would say.</li> </ul> <p>In-Depth Look at sablier</p> <ul> <li>Q: Can you tell us little bit more about subplier and what you actually do for the company?</li> <li> <p>A: At sleep later, we build a token streaming protocol. The leading Streaming protocol in crypto and so what they're consuming is basically um if I want to send you a hundred dollars over a month, I can do so using savedlayer and every second of the month you will receive a fraction of those hundred dollars. Streaming a song on Netflix on Spotify or a movie on Netflix except here it's with money. We are really shifting the way payments work by synchronizing them with time essentially. Every second you receive a fraction of those total payments. I focus mostly on you know everything that has to do with marketing sales customer support organizing events creating contents also some strategy too, also some you know coding tasks, but mostly it's it's really not technical.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: How would you end up of getting this role?</p> </li> <li>A: I worked previously at Hi-Fi so I was hired when I was 17. We' were building a fixed rate lending protocol and I started working on the community aspect and evolved mostly on working in marketing and that kind of stuff. Hi-Fi had initially acquired sabler back in the day and so I worked with Paul who is now the CEO at cedler on a regular basis at Hi-Fi, and then eventually siblier got so successful. We reached I think over a billion dollars in in TVL back in 2021 because without any marketing we did nothing, we just laid it there because the whole team was focused all the Hi-Fi Lenny portal. Paul started to think oh maybe we should spin this and</li> </ul> <p>Advice for newcomers and future and quantum computing</p> <ul> <li>Q: What's your advice for people that are still in high school or just starting university, and you're looking to get into space?</li> <li> <p>A: You don't need any degrees or anything. I mean people usually say that for startups but in crypto they really don't care.I would just join a ton of discords, become active but be careful and I think if you're trustworthy in the space, that's all that matters. It's hard ironically in crypto uh where we are building Tristram systems If you have integrity if you're a professional I think you can get a long win in crypto.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: Any thoughts about Quantum computing?</p> </li> <li>A: There is hype in the media, you don't need any degrees. One of the beautiful things about crypto is that we have a real product market fits, it is still very young, need players to do something that is actually important, useful for people in companies</li> </ul> <p>Book Recommendations</p> <ul> <li> <p>David Deutsch The Beginning of Infinity very optimistic worldview.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: and the anthropic principle from Red Hall.</p> </li> <li>A: The beginning of infinity and which really shaped my worldview basically if you ever think that through through this lens and and I think it's just an incredible book where are pretty much against calls in general to text based conversations because work much better and.yeah the beginning of The One Thing is they\u2019ve never given yield or farming.</li> </ul> <p>Governance</p> <ul> <li> <p>What are your thoughts</p> </li> <li> <p>it can't be an actual use case you could be hired to a DAO as an anonymous you won\u2019t even to call to be much more convenient and keep the commute</p> </li> <li> <p>What is actually important actually get this role so I work hi fi to build that I think there is one of the protocols have</p> </li> </ul> <p>In General</p> <ul> <li> <p>\"Trust\": One\u2019s word worth weight over marketing.

Berg, co-founder and CEO of Sablier Labs, a money streaming protocol on Ethereum.</p> <p>Part 1: Introduction (0:00 - 0:21)</p> <ul> <li>Q: Can you introduce yourself, your background, and Sablier?</li> <li>A: Paul R. Berg is the co-founder and CEO of Sablier Labs, building a money streaming protocol on Ethereum. The focus is on token investing which works by making a one-time deposit; tokens are streamed every second. He has been involved in crypto for five years.</li> </ul> <p>Part 2: Paul's background (0:21 - 1:42)</p> <ul> <li>Q: Where did you and How did you become a developer?</li> <li>A: He studied in London and naturally stumbled upon Ethereum at a Meetup event. Six months later, he dropped out of university to build startups, although they failed. He then worked for Aztec Protocol.</li> </ul> <p>Part 3: Motivations and Savior (1:42 - 3:21)</p> <ul> <li>Q: your motivations for starting seven year</li> <li>A: He watched a presentation from Andreas Antonopoulos on money streaming on the Lightning Network and realized that what was being built on Bitcoin could be done on Ethereum with Savier. It's solving our situation on ethereum there were places going with 2018 2019.</li> </ul> <p>Part 4: How Savior Works (3:21 - 4:21)</p> <ul> <li>Q: Talk about Savior is and what implications has.</li> <li>A: Savior pioneered \"lockup streaming.\" Senders deposit tokens into a contract, and every second, a small amount is streamed to the recipient. The recipient receives a payment link to track earnings and make withdrawals. Streams cannot be canceled.</li> </ul> <p>Part 5: Savings V2 (4:21 - 6:40)</p> <ul> <li>A: Savior V2 introduced NFTs - every stream is an ERC-721 NFT, integratable with DeFi. And What they Called a Lookup Dynamic allows non-linear Streaming: this kind of Incentive Structures like for example you set up an exponentially Stream:</li> <li>Q: In Exponentially More Tokens ,how do Non-linear Streaming Incentives can influence.</li> <li>A: Non-linear incentives prioritize teamCollaboration (like long-term). One implementation is a long-term contract between employee. The way it works for employee has to Stay will have more tokens. Dynamic opens a new design Space new incentive. schemes , that can incentivize to be done on chain.</li> </ul> <p>Part 6 Tax Efficiency and Nft\u2019s (6:40 - 8:59)</p> <ul> <li>Why Tax Effeciency And NFTs are important.</li> <li>A: - A V2 allows you to borrow against vesting tokens, improving capital and tax efficiency since tokens don't need to be claimed.     -NFTs allow you to put your savings into a lending protocol and borrow capital with the underlying stream acting as collateral is actually controls solving our Situation tokens tokens, which can be used, can be collateral but not just like future Earnings:</li> </ul> <p>Part 7 How Paul Berg think about building and how it relates to quantum models (8:59 - 98,42)</p> <ul> <li>a to get code a robust, what is, the approach to it from the gound up</li> <li> <p>We need is called a discrite payment biased .When you think the word payment it's like a one time Event there.</p> <p>That, to the discrep payment, so we think that block changes, What about  other that are all of that by high high   level but that's now, that's a great idea and we are like    to find the and encompasse and will you to explain all what she wants to      with our  \" .    *  *  , you're</p> </li> </ul> <p>\"</p> <p>Part 8: Longevity and Routines (41:42 - end) I was getting paid in fiat like I think to 80 on that, natural to see what is that six months later I dropped out to some startups entrepreneur Circles then Protocol that.

A: 100proof has been a software developer for approximately 18 years and has had an interest in cryptocurrency and blockchain since he was 16. He worked doing blockchains for business but felt there was not much innovation. He came across a Christophe Michelle's blog post, \"How To Be a Smart Contract Auditor\".</p> <p>Part 2: Early Days in Auditing and The Start Of Auditing (11:50 - 26:20) Getting into Code4rena</p> <p>Q: How was doing auditing in the beginning? A: 100proof felt he possessed relevant skills but didn't realize it yet which led him to join Code4rena. 100proof believes Code4rena is responsible for many joining auditing at the start.</p> <p>Part 3: From Side Hustle to Full-Time Auditor (26:20 - 40:40) How becoming an auditor gave him a way to make some money</p> <p>Q: So auditing worked out for you well, was it really the \"get rich quick\" scheme of auditing you imagined? A: 100proof couldn't have believed how well it turned out, but there's been some luck involved. \"Fortune favors the prepared mind.\" He was increasingly dissatisfied by his job.</p> <p>Part 4: The KyberSwap Exploit - Initial Feelings and Investigation (40:40 - 52:40) Looking at liquidity projects</p> <p>Q: How Did you feel during the different stages of the Khyber hack process and why did you look at it in the first place? A: He had some previous expertise in concentrated liquidity projects from earlier audits. He had found a bug in sushi swap and decided to look for other concentrated liquidity projects.</p> <p>Part 5: UniSwap, SushiSwap, &amp; Rememberance (52:40 - 59:50) Realizing the amount of dollars he found vulnerability for</p> <p>Q: Did you have a bug to start from one of the judges in a C4 contest? A: 100proof came across Christophe Michelle's blog post and was impressed. There was solid project analysis in the audit competition for sushi swap trident. Having a lot of the skills necessary for the job although not realize them at first.</p> <p>Part 6: TVL &amp; \"Proof Of Concept\" (59:50 - 81:10) Knowing the numbers behind the project's contracts</p> <p>Q: Before discovering what vulnerability you were going to look at in kyber hack where did your head go first to check? A: 100proof checks the Total Value Locked (TVL) in the project to estimate the risk and if it is worthwhile to pursue, until one day he randomly remembered a conversation about KyberSwap.</p> <p>Part 7: Concentrated Liquidity (81:10 - 90:05) 100proof explains concentrated liquidity further</p> <p>Q: Can you try to fast-forward to now, you're doing those kinds of things and it's just really cool to see that it would actually came to that realization? A: He remembered the conversation while looking at the codeArena audit competition for SushiSwap Trident. He said the depth of his understanding was so impressive, he reached out to say, wow, that's really impressive how the hell do you find things and that's how he remembered KyberSwap.</p> <p>Part 8: Diving Deeper into the Proof of Concept (90:05 - 104:40) A more in-depth explanation and proof of concept Q: So when you were going through your Khyber hack, how did you feel during the different stages of process, and how are you feeling and why you did decide to have a look at it in the first place? A: Because he gained some expertise in concentrated liquidity projects, meaning he understood them. He then found a bug in sushi swap.</p> <p>Part 9: The Process (104:40 - 122:10) Going through the process until his final moment of discovery</p> <p>Q: Alright, I'm going to cut you off here A: I did have a lot of the skills necessary for this job and didn't even realize it</p> <p>Part 10: Breaking It All Down (122:10 - 135:70) Breaking concepts down so people can better understand.</p> <p>Q: Could you perhaps give our audience - the non-technical folks- a bit of a very short analogy to describe auditing the bug that you found? A: Well, With all of these concentrated liquidity projects, it's the boundary value. Fortune favors those prepared. As a smart contract auditor you need to be very excited when those things come to realization.</p> <p>Part 11: The Art of Hacking Back Into His Own Wallet (135:70 - 140:70) Finding problems when it comes to concentrated liquidity and it's overall set up.</p> <p>Q: We fast forward to now, you're doing more or less code base and you just hoped that if I and did find some thing that they would be ament. A: Well based off of past experience an inkling of something could go wrong</p> <p>Part 12: The Final Stretch (140:70 - 158:80) Working on the proof of concept</p> <p>Q: So you look at the codebase or proof of the 8k did you take take you have to dig in and to the point that that you really your doing it? A: To put it shortly, and great. Even though I spent some time a few days working on the project they still took a few times because a few days is a few times.</p> <p>Part 13: How to Prioritize Projects Based on TVL and Bug Bounty (158:80 - 170:63) 10 Years of Dev, But Now He's Wealthy!</p> <p>Q: But the still are really to give to now, what to you're doing those it's cool A: Yeah yeah it is crazy to realized that i'm in disbelief</p> <p>Part 14: Getting to \"Go\" Time (170:63 - 192:66) 100 Proof Describes How He Learned</p> <p>Q: Yeah I'm though uh it when uh thought A: When that mean the life and I then I was - It shows try</p> <p>Part 15: Diving Into The KyberSwap Exploit (192:66 - 209:45) Diving Into The KyberSwap Exploit</p> <p>Q: you were hack feel you process?

I just bring to solidity Can you I optimize it very well So you can use it in reduction like on the review, just like people</p> <p>well, why do you know bring so much complexity back then</p> <p>it was like no, no, but it's fine Because</p> <p>I understood what</p> <p>I'm doing right now. I was like No, I did not.</p> <p>It's like uh, it's like yeah, but so it's like it's my first</p> <p>task in solidityAnd um, basically I just start from that and afterAfter</p> <p>this I was working on Smart contracts for Thekissing</p> <p>era That is currently deployed on my netAnd also</p> <p>reporting some upgrades for Zeke Yeah, Like so It's a previous version of Ziki Sing</p> <p>and who specializeIn the security side Of</p> <p>things Yeah, But it was not always the case so it's like</p> <p>Um, When I did aJob for protocol, so writing facility contracts, also researching for account abstraction,</p> <p>message passing between chains and all of this, I was really passionate about security and I was like a bit concerned about every piece of code so it's like When I did review, I'm think that obviously if</p> <p>you need to code and try you know to break it, It was intentionally uh, idea toto break the code even if it's fine.Sometimes, you can just find something very</p> <p>suspicious And, You know, you wanna Go deep into it.

They were using OpenZeppelin's ERC777 implementation.</li> <li>The Bug: The ERC777 standard has limitations on how tokens can be used in callbacks. OpenZeppelin's implementation had functionality to check if a callback was a contract, but the check was performed after the token was transferred.</li> <li>Impact: This meant a malicious actor could create a contract that didn't actually implement the callback, but would still receive the tokens.

I'll start with my crypto background.  I got into being crypto-aware around 2011 or 2012 but didn't pay much attention. I was mostly into the use case of the magic money and really look into attack. I mean I just knew Bitcoin is just minus on like the darket and the and the Internet</p> <p>Part 2: Discovery of Ethereum and Career Shift</p> <p>Q: What was is the trigger point for you?</p> <p>A:  It wasn't until 2015-2016 when I discovered Ethereum when I was basically like finishing my University degree. My degree was in logic, part of math, heart in philosophy, where my circle of friend are looking on a high level and then the company that I work or education technology.</p> <p>Part 3: Early Crypto Education Efforts</p> <p>A: In 2015-2016, I discovered Ethereum and that was the trigger point to started realizing what you can actually do with that. I started digging deeper into it and running meetups and cing workshops and learning volatility from my own and eventually I was trying to turn into Startup where I was basically the youngest co-founder.</p> <p>I mean not authority but, like, a certification company with like run educational courses would stand the certification to chain.</p> <p>Part 4: Leaving Education Tech and Joining Ethereum Foundation</p> <p>A:  Everyone was skeptical about crypto, in the company obviously and so I decided to just leave and pursue a career. Which wasn't by choice, but it was the circumstance where I was the workshop people.</p> <p>And people started asking, for like three mons development of smart contract. At first I need it for free and I don't know you know but I didn't even know enough and it's just like inbound demands. And Eventually I stared Happ. but I don't really have any time. That\u2019s when I get offer from the foundation to join whole time. story.</p> <p>Part 5:  Experience at Ethereum Foundation</p> <p>A:   Story short. I spent like four years with the I was basically losing my coding skills.  they call to hackathon, we heck I wrote as what pawn is now, where there were no price so I met a lot of people from The Ether Organization was like before, with def being prepared.</p> <p>To basically like NOAA and and you know just I spent a short to the and spent year on joining my coding skills. After Def Con 4 Def Con 4 and get offered the ether the join join my time with in.</p> <p>Part 6: Pawn Protocol - Genesis and Design</p> <p>A: In 2020-2021 we actually pursue this as a startup because it was my tendency to naturally do, so we raised and raise 20 people and started working on this this has this is been doing since yeah cool trajectory taking to a developer who is the switch from be free to Natural Evolution.</p> <p>Clients discode and, then you decided can i a try they and. so, much, in, 2020 then the 21 we find this the natural evolution.</p> <p>Q: Tell us more about Pawn Protocol.</p> <p>A: Pawn is generalized borrowing and lending protocol where there were basically like new white place. There were no price article that was pretty elementary setup for lending that. so like yeah like this and this is this has this has what I\u2019ve been doing cool trajectory taking.</p> <p>Part 7: Security Through Simpleity and Decentralization</p> <p>A: Since there was and so many tools back then. But now it\u00b4s a lot better but I audited I'm kind of happy. With I can't really all their exploit I'm pretty I will say.</p> <p>Clients level that they or level then, bunch from that getum before all.</p> <p>Part 8: Ethereum Foundation Experience Part 2</p> <p>Q: Talk about your experience in Ethereum Foundation.</p> <p>A: I was super super happy and it wasn't by design I like opportunity. To and everything that got said they get me.</p> <p>There were bunch folks the foundation was Defcom before, already like you to reference talk from like and circles from multiple eventually started coding and started doing context you I living solidia 2018.</p> <p>Part 9: The Long Term Vision of Pawn</p> <p>A: In short, was long to Ethereum and kind trigger points this what able are is unprecedented products to start digging deeper.</p> <p>Can tools so I digging that workshop my young co-founder like just not necessary Authority or authority educational.

A: His entry wasn't intentional, it began with taking a break year, exploring language models and solidity, leading to an immediate connection with the different feel of solidity.</p> <p>Career Path &amp; Finding Security Bug</p> <p>Q: What did you do since that day you liked solidity? A: After that year's detour, Obront began freelancing and exploring security aspects by participating in capture the flag (CTF) contests like OpenZeppelin CTF.</p> <p>Q: Did you have fun doing that? A: Yes. He spent a week on it every day and figuring out these new things to him and not know any of the security ideas but got deeply into playing and found a real bug in their code and that was real and cool for him.</p> <p>Q: You found a bug in their code, I can't believe this... A: He found how, like, the a real developer , could be found a bug in the contest and what are the issues</p> <p>Collaboration and learning in contesters</p> <p>Q: What happened then? How did they improved? A: Later he partnered with someone and found the collaboration so helpful and helpful for him. Both saw things differently, helping him calibrate is view and calibration.</p> <p>Q: What helped this collaboration? A: Calibrating there, and after this, one month actually and really trying with him all of a sudden, he clicked all right and now I can actually do this.</p> <p>Evolution as an Auditor</p> <p>Q: How has your auditing approach changed through your journey? A: At the beginning, it was rushed and not thorough. As it progressed, I built more systems what would happen when working and I need to learn what to learn what am I missing.</p> <p>Q: So you did any contest I'm doing, think about like, Why did I miss that? A: And what could I have done and to catch it and what is there like technical knowledge, I, was missing that I should learn. Trying, feel in all those gaps.</p> <p>Q: so how database had that do is what what the tools you use change at all since that period? A: The tools changed not much. Because he wants the database for being little more regimented and at some point he realized that the database helped him simplify the auditing. </p> <p>Q: What was trigger the thing what was in your mind was you had a job a job they like got ingrained you like I so what what kind of like triggers? A: Triggers that comes to the mind now, you know like it did a job, then like this job, you know, the job they do do, you you got ingrained, the what you mean?</p> <p>Tools and Approach</p> <p>Q: So you you still not what do you you do you do any diagrams? A: Primarily, he's taged on vs code because \"that is like my what guidance.\" and remarkable tablets.</p> <p>Q: Why you do you draw those stuff? A: Mostly sketching things what make sense to them, their patterns, deep dive places, reviews.</p> <p>Formal Verification</p> <p>Q: Do the diagrams the diagram is still the same you have you in formal verification those? A: The formal verification translation functions in pure math translated and if these statements that capture only the state changes, we had that like then it allows myself to move slowly.</p> <p>Q: Is there an excuse from that test I will sent me the other the show was much for sure. A: If I sending if, if if I send you an honest good file would be okay if I'm kind of unimpressed, which is good.</p> <p>Q: All what were some of the properties? A: Incredibly fun loved and yeah have way too many things I want for non stop Focus on it .</p> <p>Collaboration and Learning from Others</p> <p>Q: What made it helpful for you working for for work? A: For a lot of accelerating did and and did little bounty has some are good results with this thing and and then so he started to get me to see.</p> <p>Q: When he saw his you know was did you say hey then you something was like a medium a severity that you should should be something get it like really help me like calibrating? A: calibrate there and after those like month of really trying a month with him all of a sudden, I'm clicked</p> <p>The Power of Perspective</p> <p>Q: So did you think that's help has always to you know in a in a really different way. A: Both saw things things in a a really different way, and also was much better.</p> <p>Q: Do you you say, like hey this this little thing is saying isn't it a big de actually like look at the situation this this could actually be be like a medium severity thing that you should be submitting. A: Like really helped me with like calibrating there. \"look at the situation is be medium severity you submit them!\"</p> <p>Advice for aspiring Auditors</p> <p>Q: that has your audit approach change much I remember you saying that you had a a question base. A: went through it the beginning it was like so rushed and thorough and slowly I built more systems is and what's a was like oh need to learn mode anything.</p> <p>Q: What about you you overall approach that use chains your tools and tools that? A: feel like it you can like open up a code contest of it It skim and then ignored anything wasn't still.</p> <p>Q: So, like from this, let's call August. A: I did a bunch of code and and failed miserably at every single one uh.</p> <p>Q: Could not quite get it to to work maybe it was July whatever middle last sum? A: Okay cool. Like time for me to move from to end up in the</p> <p>Final Thoughts and Call to Action</p> <p>Q: How do I store that stuff to like have like that was you share us and share? A: Yeah I'll share it with what you think okay cool time for me to move to other.</p> <p>Q: Does the other projects booked some So like I did I, one contest what what do do the mean I feel like it that's has has all has been been like more? A: Yeah, then like started to so this was like that was like last summer August I like did a bunch arena contests and failed miserably at every single.</p> <p>Q: So any of the stuff to move to the next thing is that's where were you really said of a can for. A: I'm four months into learning solidity I think it's really fun four and have like way many things I want to this and have has just have been that's that's all.</p> <p>Q: There's thing acceleration which I uh did little bounty hunting and had some really good results with that and then? A: I'll be on trying to the best bugs I can and since you started having some success as an auditor has your auditing approach changed much I remember.</p> <p>Q: Do know I a question based data database based on on the the problems you couldn't solve and then what questions you used to ask yourself? A: Do you still use that has your overall approach or tools that use change at all since that per Yeah, I feel like.</p> <p>Q: When say what's an example? A: I kind of went in beginning, it was like so rushed and not thorough and slowly I kind of like built up more systems in some way that.</p> <p>Q: If I I, knew was going to be good. A: At this would would I want to be happy I.</p> <p>This summary provides a structured overview of the key points discussed in the interview.

She joined Code4rena in May 2021 when it was still relatively early and figuring things out, and is currently the Head of Product Ops.</li> </ul> <p>Part 2: Joining Code4rena and Early Days</p> <ul> <li>Q: How did you first get involved with Code4rena?</li> <li> <p>A: She was asked to join by Sock, with whom she had worked on other projects. Despite not knowing much about Web3 or security, Sock believed her skills in event management, community management, business organization, and working with developers would be valuable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: What was it like in the early days at Code4rena?</p> </li> <li>A: The early days were a learning curve. The amount of processes now present had to be implemented.</li> </ul> <p>Part 3: Code4rena's Evolution</p> <ul> <li>Q: In the 2.5 years you've been involved, what's changed at Code4rena?</li> <li> <p>A: The number of audits has increased, as well as the community size. Processes have emerged to scale. A key focus is on aligning different incentives with open-source projects (audits and compensation).</p> <p>The quality of audits has improved thanks to high quality judges.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Part 4: The Magic of Fresh Eyes(New Talent)</p> <ul> <li>A: There's something special about bringing on a new one of our developers. A lot of our folks have never learned so much about the project as when they onboard the new developer into them. There's something so magical about fresh eyes. Even strong chain links need to come knowing not to underestimate a new face, since they do have incredible insight. A lot of projects don't have the skills for onboarding.</li> </ul> <p>Part 5: The Educational Aspect and the Role of Product Ops</p> <ul> <li>A: Code4rena has an educational component and there's not necessarily an educational code. That's how it was created that got her hooked and kept her around. Now as Lead of Product ops she tries to support and guide the developers of contest admins who run competitions. This also involves supporting sponsors. It was delivering all aspects of what they do.</li> </ul> <p>Part 6: Balancing Sponsor Needs and Warden Security</p> <ul> <li>Q: What unique elements do you think Code4rena brings to the table?</li> <li>A: It balances needs to prioritize projects' security with opportunities for freelance security researchers. It provides opportunities for people to run their own business, like invoicing and billing.</li> </ul> <p>Part 7: Leveling the Web3 Ecosystem Playing Field *  A: Believes that it's all about leveling up the whole ecosystem by providing people who wouldn't otherwise have the capital with a new opportunity.</p> <p>Part 8: Focus On Processes and Impartiality</p> <ul> <li>A: Code4rena is heavily focused on open-source. Ellie was excited about that aspect because it levels up the whole ecosystem. Code4rena has built repeatable processes that are fair and prioritize the security of projects, while attempting to provide opportunities for wardens.     The people in chain are all seasoned with years of experience, because they have previously built successful businesses.</li> </ul> <p>Part 9: Code4rena's Growth and Community Insights</p> <ul> <li>A: Ellie and Jay reminisced about the old days (early 2021), when they would launch one audit per week. Now running many more all at a time. She sees a greater variety of offerings now.</li> <li> <p>They are working to build new processes. Processes are thoroughly and correctly made throughout by a team.</p> </li> <li> <p>A: The og team of wardens have been building with us in C4. Contributed massively.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Part 10: The Numbers and Current Project Focuses</p> <ul> <li>A: There are over 5,000 registered wardens in code4rena now. Not all have competed necessarily. Code4rena still has data migration issues they're working through, has repeatable processes that is making projects secure without too much manual effort.</li> </ul> <p>Part 11: Addressing AI and Code Generation</p> <ul> <li> <p>A lot of platforms have unintended consequences on display. You think they are doing X when they are actually doing Y, Zed, and ABC.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: What about the rise of Al and Code generation?</p> </li> <li>A: Ellie thinks about Kevin Kelly saying you can either resist change or try to work with it.</li> </ul> <p>Part 12: Bot Races to Enforce Rules</p> <ul> <li> <p>A: Some Wardens are using GTP to clean up grammar to try to make repos more legible: \"we need to level the ecosystem playing field and that there's a need for new educational content</p> </li> <li> <p>A: C4 is having its first Cod Arina Supreme session where senior judges go in to review audit issues of the bot races and code.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Part 13: Advice for Wardens</p> <ul> <li>The #1 tip is read old reports and look at what analysts were doing then and more recent, and how did those people perceive the project. The best to learn code is to teach code. There are tons of great people posting in the shared educational channel, that I would encourage beginners to check out and learn!</li> <li>The quantity has for sure increased a lot. 5,000 registered wardens. Number of different offerings/competitions available. The community has grown exponentially.</li> </ul> <p>Part 14: Code C4rena's Future *   At the end of that, there's some excitement with all of those new C4 additions!</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Proof%20Of%20Podcast/20231127_Ed%2C%20Valantis%20CTO_%20Disrupting%20the%20AMM%20space/","title":"Ed, Valantis CTO: Disrupting the AMM space","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20231127</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9rMTj_wNg8</p> <p>Okay, here's a summary of the YouTube video titled \"Ed, Valantis CTO: Disrupting the AMM space\", following the interview flow:</p> <p>Introduction</p> <ul> <li>Q: Please introduce yourself.</li> <li>A: Ed, based in London, building the Valantis protocol.</li> </ul> <p>Background and Education</p> <ul> <li>Q: Tell us about your background.</li> <li>A: Started with undergrad in physics, then got interested in machine learning/AI. Did some undergrad programming, then postgrad in machine learning. Worked in AI and started a startup.</li> </ul> <p>Early Career and Crypto Discovery * Q: What made you switch from machine learning to crypto? * A: Was in the middle of PhD. and was surrounded by software engineers. Merging computers and data to making prediction was interesting. AI felt stressful as results weren't always as sure as Software engineering where you could get from A to B. Decided build a startup with a friend which was AI based.</p> <p>Diving into DeFi</p> <ul> <li>Q: How did you get into crypto?</li> <li>A: Got into crypto by accident in 2021, prompted by news and a lack of local knowledge of Ethereum, private keys, and blockchain. Read a book, started learning the terms around crypto and wanted to experience using the system.</li> </ul> <p>First Experiences with AMMs</p> <ul> <li>Q: What interested you then?</li> <li> <p>A: Purchased some ETH, and then quickly started trying out Uniswap. Became expensive to operate directly in ETH, so started experimenting within Polygon to interact with various decentralized applications</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: What were your thoughts as you starting using the apps?</p> </li> <li>A:  Felt like a casino. Tokens had \"rug pulls\" and so he lost a small amount amount playing around. Saw high frequency traders were making profit in the pools and was curious how they were doing it</li> <li>Q: Realized AI or software engineering background more helpful?</li> <li>A: From AI side, didn't feel empowered as all the compute was expensive, and it was pivoting to game engine programming, getting in Unity. Got bullish in 2021 in crypto</li> </ul> <p>Transition to Becoming Technical in DeFi</p> <ul> <li>Q: When did you start being technical in DeFi?</li> <li>A: Couldn't stop thinking about DeFi, and realized I wanted to code smart contracts. Learned Solidity, reverse engineered code to understand how to work protocols, so could start programming M-pool. Learned painful lesson that simulations don't work very well on mainnet as there are attacks, tokens etc.</li> </ul> <p>Joining Gelato and Next Steps</p> <ul> <li>Q: How was your experience then?</li> <li>A: Pivoted then doing game editor programming and working about Unity. That's when got really into like software engineering. That got my in to Crytpo accidently Joined Gelato network as a core developer with part time job, to try finish of the PhD . Saw lots of protocol had smart contracts to test</li> </ul> <p>Overview of Valantis Protocol</p> <ul> <li>Q: How did you go from working like that, to building Valantis protocol?</li> <li>A: \"I couldn't stop thinking about defi\"</li> </ul> <p>Q: Whats the difference between existing dex models/ what makes your approach fresh? A: existing Dex models do no allow the developer for great level customization and flexibility. Instead, Valtanis is designing a model is that is: reusable, and contains multiple modular structures at the same</p> <p>The Modular Approach of Valantis The major module is AMM core ( contains swap function), has an additional option of decentralized oracles, a verifier module. A: Want it to be \"plug and play\", easy to use for the user and highly scalable to meet different demand (such as rebased tokens</p> <p>The Long Term Vision Has this view always been part of the strategy, or more recently, that\u2019s something that the team are heading to now?</p> <ul> <li>Q: Is that right?</li> <li>A: That was moment dropped what was doing because what I knew was \"mind blowing, which combined AI and code completion\". There wasn't much time as have a deadline. However at the end there's two areas: Reusability and having power to hit target.

Q: How is your auditing process different from Spearbit?. How evolved that? Q: When you started doing contests, what did clients look for?</p> <p>Core Summary: Exploring the evolution of Liam's auditing process and perspective.</p> <p>A: When he started in contests, he began with lower-hanging fruit, focusing on gas optimization and informational issues, which were more lucrative back then.  Now it is more common to file a QA report. The feedback loop in contests was super short with multiple audits per week, providing him with immediate feedback that sped up his journey, now a little bit more selective with QA and more about holistic with more weight on gas optimization, and informationals . Moving to Spearbit, he's now more thorough at the start of the process, finding real issues. He was \"too lazy\" to focus on minor low-level bugs in contests, focusing on medium and high severity issues due to shorter feedback cycle. Now he's teaming up with other Auditors.</p> <p>Core Summary: His approach evolved to focus on high-impact vulnerabilities, becoming more lucrative. He actively avoids tedious work likes reports by focusing on better practices and methods. Then moving to SpearBit, now more thorough at the start of the process, finding high-severity issues.

A: Miguel de Vega introduces himself. His background is at the intersection of technology and math. His formal education was in Telecom Engineering, completed by a PhD in mathematics. Then he worked at Siemens in Germany, solving advanced mathematical problems required by every business unit.</p> <p>Q: So what drove you to crypto and now you are a founder of Nillion? So what happened in the meantime from getting really interested into crypto to uh, starting your own project in the space yeah. A: Miguel met Andrew Masanto in 2017 and they explored applying cryptography to problems in Web3, with Alex Page (Nilon CEO) and Andrew Yio (CMO). This led to brainstorming how a certain piece of math could turn into technology, eventually forming the vision for Nillion: a decentralized platform for secure storage and computation of sensitive information.</p> <p>What is Nillion? What is MPC?</p> <p>Q: Start by kind of giving a preface of what is NPC [sic], MPC... A:  MPC stands for Multiparty Computation. It is any computation where there are many parties, usually controlled by different companies that collaborate to jointly compute a program/function while not sharing the inputs. In this set up they\u00b4re able to maintain the privacy of their inputs and come up with the result from that computation, but wihout running it on a single computer.</p> <p>What is special about Nillion? A different Architecture?</p> <p>Q: Let's talk about the weights of those differences. Can we get a brief overview or high level review of what it is, uh, what Nillion is and from like a practical stand point. A:  Nillion is web3 infrastructure, meaning it isn't run by a single entity, however nodes runs by different entities where governance is by a Swiss Association (controlled by token holders). What sets it apart is being for General compute and storage. By addressing computing stuff without sharing information.</p> <p>How to Understand the Need for Nillion's Solution?</p> <p>Q: [...]What drove the creation in the first place? A: Nillion tackles the \"unwritten rule of the internet,\" which states that every time you interact with an internet service provider, you have to give them part of yourself.  This piece of your personal identity and data is then irreversibly transferred, losing control of that information.  Nillion aims to change that paradigm.</p> <p>Q: But there's others uh there's other UM pets or or Ps um privacy enhancing Technologies that are very interesting indeed um you have fully homemorphic encryption, you have differential privacy you have multi-party computation so that takes us to this MPC UM acronym what it means. A: Existing privacy-enhancing technologies like FH and differential privacy operate on a client-server model.  Nillion, on the other hand, utilizes a network-based architecture more akin to decentralized web3 systems. This makes removing trust possible by means this novel technology.</p> <p>Benefits and Use Cases of Utilizing Nillion</p> <p>Q: So with that being said, you combine it with web3 which is all about community and collaboration and also trust or trust minimization this could be a perfect match and   we kind of then set ourselves to um create this public decentralized UM platform for secure storage and compute of of sensitive information whatever you may be you know it can be from people it can be from companies from government so that was a little bit kind of the thought process. A: Miguel explains further that their design enables collaboration without sharing data in a secure way. So the benefits is for: * Secure Smart Contract Execution. * Adding Privacy to NFTs. * Private DAO voting. * The Internet, which happens to be that one thing made by humans that is so complex that requires that special type of maths. Fractal geomentry. Which is what Nillion offers.</p> <p>Technical Breakthroughs and RoadMap</p> <p>Q: So what kind of uh what sort of possibilities can emerge from that, that what are the practical things that can happen having that kind of capabilities on a technological level. A: Building effective compilers to bridge the gap between high-level descriptions of problems and low-level representations. It was also important to build technology in what Nillion believes in its core-vission.</p> <p>Q: And kind of the last question. What's the estimated date where people are going to be able to try to build things onon. A: They aims an \"open\" testnet during week of the 7th of November (check their Twitter account Andrew.Yo@nillion.com)</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Proof%20Of%20Podcast/20231224_Antonio%20Viggiano_%20Teach%20Me%20How%20To%20Fuzz/","title":"Antonio Viggiano: Teach Me How To Fuzz","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20231224</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbujABFgyng</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Proof%20Of%20Podcast/20231224_Antonio%20Viggiano_%20Teach%20Me%20How%20To%20Fuzz/#antonio-viggiano-teach-me-how-to-fuzz-interview-summary","title":"\"Antonio Viggiano: Teach Me How to Fuzz\" - Interview Summary","text":"<p>This is a summary of the YouTube video \"Antonio Viggiano: Teach Me How to Fuzz\", structured with Q&amp;A format to mirror the interview's flow.</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Proof%20Of%20Podcast/20231224_Antonio%20Viggiano_%20Teach%20Me%20How%20To%20Fuzz/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Q: Please introduce yourself.</p> <p>A: Antonio Viggiano is an independent security researcher working mostly with smart contracts.

He previously worked at Pangolin Exchange on Avalanche, contributing to staking functionalities.</p> <p>Q: What do you make of the recent Avax activity?</p> <p>A: He notes the recent \"heat\" and hype around Avalanche Community and the importance of responsible decision making amid the hype.</p> <p>Q: How did you get into crypto?</p> <p>A: He says he was initially drawn to crypto through libertarian values, aspiring to be his own bank.  His entry point was Avalanche which gives it a special place in his heart and appreciated that each new fork was an opportunity to learn the existing code.</p> <p>Part 2: Path to Security Research</p> <p>Q: Why Avalanche?</p> <p>A: He was initially drawn to the tokenomics but quickly transitioned to the technology.  He started following the project after reading their whitepaper and was engaged when the Avalanche Bridge was deployed.</p> <p>Q: Can you expand on your technical growth?</p> <p>A: It began as a user of Avalanche and then TXS. As the project developed, he made crypto friends. All his learning experience led him to becoming a Solidity expert.</p> <p>Q: How can someone get to your coding level, with that gradual learning process?</p> <p>A: Need good standards, making everything immutable aligning with blockchain philosophy and gas optimization.</p> <p>Part 3: The Uniswap V3 Bug and Report Style</p> <p>Q: Why do you include humor in your bug reports? A: You need to have some standards. To make things immutable for example which aligns with the philosophy of the blockchain. He says it will make the experience for other learners better.</p> <p>Q: How did you get with Bengal index? A: He has libertarian values as well.</p> <p>Q: How did Bengal index capture you?</p> <p>A: NFT project got his parents involved with drawing most of the traits in that project.  Then, through an internship, he was starting to become more interested in development. He didn't know Solidity code, copy and pasting but this way he learned the APIs works.</p> <p>Q: How did you get to Pangolin?</p> <p>A: There was an intern position. After doing that position, they invited him to join. The top was Justin!</p> <p>Q: How did Pangolin led into the independent auditing career?</p> <p>A: There were experiences with bugs. Then a new job offered that!</p> <p>Q: How did his journey to Spearbit begin:</p> <p>A: A guy from Turkey went to a blockchain event and Shung spoke with him and asked Shah's parents</p> <p>Q: So can can u tell us a uniswap V3 bug?</p> <p>A: The code will pass all codes and unit test. Still there was the bug but most reports are extremely hard</p> <p>Q: So can we have a colorful report like yours? A: There is 60 70% luck, it was a big part of it</p> <p>Q: How to avoid it for new auditing beginners? A: Do not be irresponsible, it is a meme and hype, make sure to have the code audited</p> <p>Q: Talk more detail for these Uniswap V3 bug</p> <p>A: Basically his code was sent to spear bits, where Bhauhum found a uniswap V3 bug</p> <p>The bug in Uniswap V3 was related to the settlement design and the use of a logarithm function. A flaw in how this logarithm function handled numbers with decimal points would cause the incorrect return of a number</p> <p>This \"luck\" leaded him to that bug due that there was that issue.</p> <p>Part 4: Advice and Future of Audited Security</p> <p>Q: What would you suggest for building that auditing or security career?</p> <p>A: Take it slowly and always read other people's. Standards are very very important for improving your learning. Gas Optimization. To have something immutable! That aligns with a blockchain.</p> <p>Q: How should people test, code, approach building in web3? A: Rewrites stuff based on his standards. Get everything optimized</p> <p>Q: How can people work with you? A: He had cryptocurrency friends.</p> <p>Q: What is your opinion to Web Free if the security tools have AI improving them more</p> <p>A: Web free security will not get better. Learn security and has that experience from spearbit and so, you can have more control by getting crypto friends to help</p> <p>Q: Did you think they would be able to put a stop to that type of hack *A: No, all developer must need to know the security and be a expert on it. *</p> <p>Finally, Shung encourages newcomers to learn, share, and contribute and learn what they are building. He emphasizes that security is everyone's responsibility in the web3 space.</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Proof%20Of%20Podcast/20240217_Alex%20The%20Entreprenerd_%20One%20Click%20Testing%20Suites/","title":"Alex The Entreprenerd: One Click Testing Suites","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20240217</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcrPtNvCbEc</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Proof%20Of%20Podcast/20240217_Alex%20The%20Entreprenerd_%20One%20Click%20Testing%20Suites/#summary-of-alex-the-entreprenerd-one-click-testing-suites","title":"Summary of \"Alex The Entreprenerd: One Click Testing Suites\"","text":"<p>This is a summary of an interview with an smart contracts security expert, focusing on the landscape, challenges, and the future of smart contract security, particularly in the context of bug bounties and \"one-click\" testing suites. The discussion is divided into several key areas, with the format being question (Q) and summarized answer (A).</p> <p>Individual vs. Team Research:</p> <ul> <li>Q: What is the potential of solo smart contract security researchers compared to teams? What types of bounties save time and resources?</li> <li>A: Solo researchers can be more effective due to scaling and coordination challenges with teams. Four focused solar researchers that may have better bank for their time than a team. Bounties that are well organized and focus on niche technologies allow real saving money, especially when everybody's hyped.</li> </ul> <p>Visibility and Promotion for Researchers:</p> <ul> <li>Q: Is visibility a big problem? What are the benefits of joining a firm or team as a smart contract security researcher?</li> <li>A: Researchers have visibility problem. By joining firm or team they can get that promotion. There are two sides: first side is yes you will get more engagements because your brand is being offered and second side is NO, if the quality is poor (\"you suck\"). Therefore, one should become good to get good. To be shorthand as one joins a team when LSR (like someone leaves, is away, etc.)</li> </ul> <p>Code Arena Contests vs. Bug Bounties:</p> <ul> <li>Q: What are the reasons and concerns with doing contest? What the project can offer? Is is Wourse for porjects?</li> <li>A: In research, if one gets short-handed, one are getting the spear bit per week pay. For code arena contests are great, they get all the attention, super safe because you know all the top people doing it and you trust it. Is is worse because its getting the projects what do projects offer - that it became difficult to choose.</li> </ul> <p>The Changing Pace of Security:</p> <ul> <li>Q: What are some essential key take-aways to keep in mind?</li> <li>A: Because the fast options are coming the new players in the industry so branching out a lot from contest like this, make real spread out - hard for the proje perspective.</li> </ul> <p>Evolving Landscape and Visibility:</p> <ul> <li>Q: Which is the better approach - joining existing firm, or building your own brand?</li> <li>A: The only concern is weather all this contests is good or bad for the projects because i believe it is worse for the projects</li> </ul> <p>Recon: Aiming for One-Click Testing Suites.</p> <ul> <li>Q: Given this landscape, what is the vision for Recon you discussed?</li> <li>A: In general, you should evaluate critically your results and what happened but you should also be confident in what happens.     I believe that solo researchers will do the best uh, in the in the bull because Teams are too hard to they're too hard to scale and they're too hard to work</li> </ul> <p>One-CLick Vision:</p> <ul> <li>A: The vision that makes it easy with this new system is just click a button and all of the actions would be called by scaffolded contacts then we have the possibility of tracking its own firm watchback as its own from of labs probably has his own firm.</li> </ul> <p>The \"Three-Tier\" Approach:</p> <ul> <li>Q: What are some additional key elements we need to consider? As new options arrive in different ways a \"three-tier\" scenario starts happening.</li> <li>A: The goal is that we can get you writing invariant tests within uh, it's it's a fundamental issues for projects not necessarily for researchers. Researchers are essentially uh, if you hire. So, the chances of always having this top tier researchers becomes Le becomes a bit lower and, so that's where you know, the film becomes more uh, a guaranteed guarantee.</li> </ul> <p>Finding enjoyment:</p> <ul> <li>A: Try to find what is going get to me, so, it's if I just drop everything and I just do contest I'm like, you know give me that or [\u00a0__\u00a0] off.</li> </ul> <p>Game Theory of Choices:</p> <ul> <li>Q: Can we start seeing 3, or 4 different contes a year, with prizes up to $1 mil?</li> <li>A: \"People are going to go where the money is... I really love talking about the game theory of choosing contest and figuring everything out.\" But, uh, what that I taught as know, for office hour than I with do in general or even to my students is that you you should evaluate what happening.</li> </ul> <p>Balancing Skill + Confidence:</p> <ul> <li>A: So, um, it's it's a fundamental fundamental issue for projects not necessarily for for for researchers because, as a researcher, anytime you get paid less, you'll just can do whatever pays you more which in the bull is going to be bounties.</li> </ul> <p>Open-Source and Accessibility:</p> <ul> <li>Q: How will accessability improve over time?</li> <li>A: As we move forward, uh, it's going to be bug bounties saving real money. and on the opposite side for projects, it has have to, you know, evaluate we really what you're getting then the contest. Then, uh, you have this philosophy where the better The more likely you are you want to be drawn in Work because that space to try something new.</li> </ul> <p>Recon Today (UI, One-Click Testing Suite):</p> <ul> <li>Q: Talk about Recon, big problems for platforms</li> <li>A: Great advantages for solo researchers with the flexibility of testing. Has the benefit of one touch suite to try things right away.</li> </ul> <p>Closing Thoughts on Mentality</p> <ul> <li>A: You want to ask what will you hit If you if you think so that really than have Philosophy the better you the more likely you are you all the top tier the more code basis you check.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"podcasts/Proof%20Of%20Podcast/20240302_Spadaboom_%20Lessons%20From%20Building%20BadgerDAO/","title":"Spadaboom: Lessons From Building BadgerDAO","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20240302</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfdnw_9fF3Y</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Proof%20Of%20Podcast/20240302_Spadaboom_%20Lessons%20From%20Building%20BadgerDAO/#spadaboom-lessons-from-building-badgerdao-summary","title":"Spadaboom: Lessons From Building BadgerDAO - Summary","text":"<p>This is a summarized version of the Youtube video in a Q&amp;A format.</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Proof%20Of%20Podcast/20240302_Spadaboom_%20Lessons%20From%20Building%20BadgerDAO/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>The video intro includes thanking sponsors for making the podcast possible.

Sometimes these flaws were present even in algorithms proposed by the best minds at the time. Governments, with their historical data, can ban dangerous concepts; it's a challenge to make new safe techniques, but Zero Knowledge proofs provide better safety,</p> <p>Part 3: Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Cryptography (Hotel Analogy)</p> <p>Q: Can you explain symmetric and asymmetric cryptography in simpler terms?</p> <p>A: Symmetric:  It's like having a hotel room where everyone has the same key. Asymmetric: It's like that the hotel number is on the the public internet but to access your room you need a special key that gives you control in access. Symmetric crypto uses the same key while in asymmetric cryptography there's separate private and public key pairs from the discrete log problem which can withstand attacks like Shaw's algorithm.</p> <p>Part 4: Quantum Computing's Impact and Post-Quantum Cryptography</p> <p>Q: What's the impact of quantum computing on cryptography and how are we preparing for Q resistant cryptography?</p> <p>A: Quantum computers can break current widely used public-key cryptography like integer factorization and elliptical cryptography. Research in lattice-based cryptography and other areas are being made since these problem are thought to withstand quantum computing. Symmetric cryptography requires shorter key sizes for equivalent hardness than public/asymmetric cryptography, but we are looking at new protocols now.</p> <p>Part 5: Information Theoretic Security and the One-Time Pad</p> <p>Q: Can you explain Information Theoretic Security, and is one solution?</p> <p>A:  Think of Information Theoretic Security as achieving perfect secrecy. It is achievable with things like the one-time pad, where the key is the same size as the message, one has theoretical security.</p> <p>Part 6: Practical Challenges of Key Distribution &amp; Quantum Key Distribution</p> <p>Q: What are the practical challenges with something like the one-time pad, and how do we solve it?</p> <p>A: QKD is very secure; the main issue is now sharing the one-time-pad. One way is to use Quantum Key Distribution using the BB84 standard: if someone tries to intercept the QKD, there are ways to detect to see that happened and then stop the key distribution process and start again.</p> <p>Part 7: Information-Theoretic Security vs. Computational Hardness and Quantum Resistance.</p> <p>Q: Recap the types of security discussed?</p> <p>A: Information-theoretic security provides a theoretical guarantee, but not often implementated; Quantum-resistant cryptography are based on problems currently resistant to quantum computers to prevent any attacks once a practical computer is built.</p> <p>Part 8: Current Landscape of Q-Resistance Cryptography and NIST Involvement</p> <p>Q: Can we summarize Quantum-Resistant cryptography methods?</p> <p>A: Yes, coding-theory, napsack problems with optimal constraints to ensure code strength. NIST had a big process to select algorithms; there's a mailing list to discuss. They are building a BCP class to do batch process with it.</p> <p>Part 9: The \"Bornstein\" Algorithm and Homomorphic Encryption</p> <p>Q: Is there a new computer with new potential that affect our new Q-resistant crypto?</p> <p>A: Grovers's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup which might affect symmetric encryption more than asymmetric encryption. Homomorphic encryption may help. </p> <p>Part 10:  The Potential of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)</p> <p>Q: If we were to recap this interview, what key information would be added?</p> <p>A:  ZK proofs, by nature, are perfect to implement privacy (proving something without revealing it). This can be used now to validate proofs. The best attribute is: not depending on trust; so the idea is move to a ZK mindset for maximum safety.</p> <p>Part 11: High-Level Overview of Zero-Knowledge Proofs</p> <p>Q: How do zero-knowledge proofs generally work?</p> <p>A: They lets you prove certain statements are true without revealing the information itself in computer science and mathematics.</p> <p>Part 12: Challenges without Zero-Knowledge Proofs (Hotel Analogy Revisited)</p> <p>Q: Can we compare with our previous talk?</p> <p>A: Recall our hotel analogy: I want to let you know and actually prove I am in a certain room of a hotel (e.g. I have over 25 y.o.) without revealing the number itself; in a way that other people can validate this statement being true even after I close the doors.</p> <p>Part 13: Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Compliance</p> <p>Q: How's the situation for the financial use case?</p> <p>A: ZKPs are great since they could also provide what's known as \"Zero Knowledge Compliance\" with multi-shore rules.</p> <p>Part 14: The \"Dark Pool\" Analogy</p> <p>Q: What is \"dark pool\" and how do ZKPs improve this?</p> <p>A:  It's a market where you cannot see how people bought or sell. ZKPs are valuable assets that allows many users to keep control and privacy under all conditions; however, the challenge is to agree about what to consider \"legal\". In that regard, they create a \"shielded\" state where one can prove all legal conditions of the state are met.</p> <p>Part 15: High-Level Description of Building New Public Key Protocols on Quantum Computing</p> <p>Q: What's the future like?</p> <p>A:  Symmetric key cryptography, coding theory, and other areas are possible, but there is an information-theoretic barrier. With quantum computers, you can define secure information but not linear combinations that preserve correctness.</p> <p>Part 16: Challenges to Widespread Adoption</p> <p>Q: How to solve the implementation problems?</p> <p>A: Two classes of problems exist integer factorization (the \"hardness\" of doing something based on public key sizes) increases the effort for non-linear polynominal. For example, an increase in size is not linear, it's quadratic in finding finding these values. It will take years... The other cryptography primitives exist by the means of coding theory.</p> <p>Part 17: How zero-knowledge will prevent scammers in Defi</p> <p>A: It'll be \"game changing.\" With Zero-Knowledge, one can prove their identity and eligibility without having to show trust. There will be a death of scams for those using old methods -- just imagine the possibilities.</p> <p>Part 18: Tokenomics and Design Considerations in Panther Protocol</p> <p>Q: Why did you decide to go into zero knowledge, and end up in Panther?</p> <p>A: I find finding patterns useful so that even non-linear humans can create compute, and that's why I'm in it and it reflects my philosophy.</p> <p>Part 19: Design for a Sustainable Token Model</p> <p>Q: How's the project designed to have a longer value?</p> <p>A: *Longterm decentralization is important for the protocol's construction -- * Finding cycles in a ring and finding cycles that may affect the process that takes a long time. The bat, charlie ,papa of the right kind and in one sense of peaking . Then finding cycles is a linear field and the key sides to provide some interesting value. The discrete log problems forms basis of quantum computing. One needs to remember that. </p> <p>Part 20: Real-World Usability and Adoption</p> <p>Q: What can we expect from the protocol?</p> <p>A: 2 areas of use: The problem is with the public chain, also they need information theoretic security. You need to make sure is actually more efficient and scalable, and that needs ZK tech to do the heavy liftings.  And make the chain usable.</p> <p>Q: More precise for Panther?</p> <p>A: Yes, there will be real-world usability and there also will be a need for education that goes both ways -- not top down. We're all in this new world together. </p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Proof%20Of%20Podcast/20240426_Owen%20Thurm_%20How%20Much%20Can%20You%20Earn%20With%20Pay-Per-Vulnerability_%20Is%20It%20Good%20Enough_/","title":"Owen Thurm: How Much Can You Earn With Pay-Per-Vulnerability?

After a bad audit, got more into the auditing/security space.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Owen's Background Story (0:45-3:01)</p> <ul> <li>Q: Can you give us the cliff note version and we can talk more?<ul> <li>A: I had a tiny SAS app on the side, but Instagram changed their terms, which wiped us out. Then Bitcoin, then Ethereum with the opportunity to build a D5 protocol. We had a bad audit and rescued funds, and then started auditing.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>About Paper Vulnerability (3:01-4:08)</p> <ul> <li>Q: You were probably the first one to come up with this pay per vulnerability model, or at least do it on a more scalable size. Can you talk about paper vulnerability?<ul> <li>A: The idea grew from the first audit. The cliffs notes are the small fee upfront, and then pay per finding after that.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The Offer, and Growing The Business (4:08-5:32)</p> <ul> <li>Q: How is it grown, since you talked about adding extra mechanisms to it?<ul> <li>A: Experience led to the offer. It helps new auditing firms to make a better offer. It makes it more likely to win business. It also incentivizes us to uncover these vulnerabilities.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>How Does It Work? (5:32-10:19)</p> <ul> <li>Q: What is the process for this, and also how do you assess severity?<ul> <li>A: First make sure timeline is good, scope the contracts then normalize Solidity code with a script, splitting all money, and setting a cap as needed per code base. Then share database with client real time so fix stuff happens immediately</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Differences Compared With a Traditional Auditing Model (10:19-16:35)</p> <ul> <li>Q: What's different about it?<ul> <li>A: First is risk free and great offer. Gamifying makes incentivizing, so you don't have to make as good of an offer. We've raised the down payment though. Its about high level overview for liners of code, and you get more credibility when you have more experience. Also there is a limit for a certain code base. Great way to get better results though.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>How Projects Reach Out, and Initial Steps (16:35-18:19)</p> <ul> <li>Q: Now how does a project reach out to you about doing this sort of audit? How do you handle it? How do you assess severity?<ul> <li>A: Reach out and figure out timeline, scope contracts, normalize the contracts into sloc count, determine down payment with a formula, then have a set list rate for Critical/High/Med/Low vulnerability to be uncovered.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The Rates Per Severity of Vulnerabilities (18:19-21:31)</p> <ul> <li>Q: What rates are you currently running with?<ul> <li>A: Current price is: critical $5k, high $250k, medium $1k (for new code base). This is also incentive for you to want to uncover these vulnerabilities.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Audit Experience, and Database Sharing. (21:31-23:39)</p> <ul> <li>Q: It sounds like it incentivized you to actually want to discover the vulnerabilities, rather than \"Okay, I got the money now\".<ul> <li>A: Yeah. We also share a database of the findings in real time so the client is able to see and fix.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Auditing Process (23:39-28:31)</p> <ul> <li>Q: How does the actual engagement/auditing work?<ul> <li>A: It\u2019s audit as normal, the key difference is that we get really excited when we find something. Its sort of incentivized us to actually want to uncover these vulnerabilities. Right is like okay we get the money I now I kind of just want this over with. I mean you get the money upfront only only to fund out their staff to and cover only stuff they found.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Making \"Risk-Free\" Offers (28:31-31:10)</p> <ul> <li>Q: So when you decided to to get in, you're like \"yeah, let's make a risk-free offer\".<ul> <li>A: Yes, which is exactly is what we would want. A small amount up-front, and literally only pay more if we uncover stuff for you.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>How To Get Started in Security Auditing (31:10-35:32)</p> <ul> <li>Q: If you are starting to be a solo auditor or firm, then its fantastic to do. What do you do if you are going to start doing this?<ul> <li>A: It's a better offer, absolutely, because every other firm is going to be it sounds like a fixed flat cost, comparative to your offer. Reserve this spot. This great offer you going to better win business. First, obviously, it was just incentivized us to want to uncover this vulnerabilities. Instead of okay, we need.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Incentives (35:32-37:57)</p> <ul> <li>Q: I'm almost like, \"Well, this also kinda get if I get this overview, it's a great offing.<ul> <li>A: Is incentives. It's gamified with more credibility. After, don't make good offer to win deals.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Down Payment (37:57-39:49)</p> <ul> <li>Q: In order to get the retainer down payment that it's more like, \"I'm split 50/50 so usually about 50% of the money\", and everything come from the paying up front, and what do you put into the PPV fees that can be agreed on from ahead of point?<ul> <li>A: About 50% was down payment to reserve the sport from time, code bases can be expensive and I'd want an audit to be where I only pay if I actually get some vulnerabilities uncovered.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Dealing With Cap Agreements (39:49-40:47)</p> <ul> <li>Q: Then we implement to cap or something can be agreed from ahead a time they cause sometimes code basis just happen to have one he critical vulnerabilities in it that those audits can come out very expensive.<ul> <li>A: Agree. Those audits can come out expensive.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Projects Reaching Out and Timeline (40:47-42:29)</p> <ul> <li>Q: So how does it work of when a project reaches out to you saying we're interested in this kind of audit and till the report is finalized so how do you do this coping? How do you assess the severity? How do you communicate so this is different in your model than a traditionaling model where is there any the main differences.<ul> <li>A: It's more like advertisement.

Web2 had certain structure but tooling in Web3 was lacking. Web3 doesn't have a lot of structure to it and the tooling wasn't as well-developed. The goal is to solve problems related to auditing.</li> </ul> <p>Part 2: Audit Wizard's Approach &amp; User Perspective</p> <ul> <li>Q: What's the core philosophy behind Audit Wizard, and what problems are you trying to solve for auditors and developers?</li> <li>A: From auditor background the core is I was using developer tools to do security engineering work and that always felt a little bit clunky. Need tools to understand code I need tools that give me insights I need to be able to run scanning tools really easily. What do you need that could run some tests and things like that is something you plan to implement.</li> </ul> <p>Part 3: Core Features and Future Vision</p> <ul> <li>Q: Is that something you plan to implement in Audit Wizard, like running testing suits for the projects or fuzz integrated, something like this?</li> <li>A: The vision is to make Audit Wizard this singular place for you to do everything you need. Testing stays really important. One thing we're working on that we think is taking a step back and looking at auditing as a whole identifying where do you what's the most impactful thing to do.</li> </ul> <p>Part 4: Code Editing and AI Integration</p> <ul> <li>Q: Are there tools that you want them to be able to use in order to even add it to the code maybe is that's something that you guys also think is going to be able to implemented or something you guys already have in mind?</li> <li>A: We're going to adding the ability to edit the code, to write template tests. You can run tests but you can create templates. You think the way we described the one the possibilities on how to edit a code is definitely something that. That we're also planning.</li> </ul> <p>Part 5: Business Model and Future Plans</p> <ul> <li>Q: What is the plan for the tool to remain like open source to everyone for everyone or do you guys intend to implement some type of charging at some point?</li> <li>A: Auto Wizard everything's been free. Pro Plan with more core features.     Have the ability to run tests and a little notepad where can create them and help there's always something more to do just one-stop shop, the only thing you have is auto work yeah.</li> </ul> <p>Part 6: Differentiation from Other security Tools &amp; Long-Term Vision</p> <ul> <li>Q: So it do you run formal interviews or is it just kind of like a brainstorming exercise and maybe picking someone's brains every now and then?And how are you different from other security tools?</li> <li>A: All operate on and zooming out in the long term Vision is make audience wizard on the thing you have open the that's what they're to all, they made me in the best but the AI the lack of lack of lack to do yeah and the need a testing.</li> </ul> <p>Part 7: AI Strategy</p> <ul> <li>Q: What it I are you guys using for the is it just using chat GPT or are you guys using some other some of other models?</li> <li>A: It's just GPT all llm based why can AI features contained in the land stuff it easy that help is.</li> </ul> <p>Part 8: Threat Modeling and Web 3 Security Differences * Q: Do you have like a a mind map of priorities or just different areas that this software needs to like the main areas that you guys focus when you're developing and thinking about new features? Is there a roadmap? * A:  This was all about high priorities in security in with but you take those.

Has been around for almost 3 years, started in late 2020/early 2021 during a MarketMake hackathon. Aversion and I came out. Initially focused on smart contract coverage.</p> <p>Background and Motivation: *   Q: Can you talk about all the problems that you saw that kind of brought you into DeFi in the first place? *   A: Financial background, financial travels, used to figure out how bank stocks on quarter, and I worked at Citadel Equity Trading. It wasn't interesting but taught me a ton about financial problems and seeing defi like fresh air. Clear DeFi future, got to get one country to awesome financial system. Sherlock was started because make sure defi is accessible to billions people. The biggest area that we didn't see a lot of great efforts in was the security space so that can be trusted.</p> <p>Sherlock's Focus and How it Works: *   Q: Can you hear more about all of the the problems that you saw traff that kind of brought you into DeFi in the first place? *   A: Okey there needs to be a smart contract coverage can never 100% Uni swap V1 it causes everybody wrecked. You do need backup stop in crypto and people are putting in crypto saving in side. Avert building smart contracts. I buid front end that's how it started and gitcon investors through alliance kicked start get it. The original was smart contracts could, a financial that we can never, that's issue in DFI make sure my money that's why into the cover of realm.</p> <p>Auditing Piece and Community : *   Q: Can you hear more about auditting community *   A: Auditing later love cover customers with the audit causing for us on all these hacks and bug so, that's in auditing of so, that I wanna see prob taff traffic me in,</p> <p>First, you really saw make better so that Citadel would send me around 1st class to go talk big banks that they never heard of. All exist Ohio regions,  Were a tottaly different world and world. All did and know were trying to, but was what I call this what one allowed to, they all jackets and all can to than next,</p> <p>Wasn't all is why those guys to do future one use was. This how came out can't all these guys. Tech knew even. I trying to CFO, trying to it and had tech so built and in wasn't. But kind how I went, kernel with me. Contests and Judging Distinctions: *   Q: So when the Sherlock was to build smart contract *   A: Started to help about how, make sure that actually million people one of the efforts security a lot we trust any there is needs more contract make users into, So side and built contracts contracts.  Went kernel investors through Alliance on and get that the contract and on the  that that really the audit we love I was.</p> <ul> <li>Q: Cool cool I want to hear more about all the problems saw trafi that brought you into DeFi in first place like are things that you really saw DeFi it better</li> <li>A: So that crazy that would literally be Citadel around class to go talk to CEOs CFOs some banks that you've literally heard of BB&amp;T and Key Bank all.</li> </ul> <p>Addressing Issues in Traditional Audits: *   Q:  I want to hear more about all problems trafi that for places like *   A: Talk these exist in talk guys just different the US in Ohio was different their investors make. It happen I do.</p> <p>Addressing Bias and Prioritizing Vulnerabilities in Audits: *   Q: Tell me a bit the auding. *   A: I'm hear to saw so yeah you are not. We do left we talk later that get in the auditor.

Addicted to video games like Minecraft and CSGO, and there is a link between video games and programming. There's wanted me to code as well, and I did that to give me coding courses, like Harvard CS50.</p> <p>Current Work: Thunderhead and Liquid Staking</p> <p>Q: What are you doing right now with Thunderhead?</p> <p>A: Focus on building liquid staking tokens for newer blockchain networks. They've built community dashboards protocol contributions but now they are solely focusing on liquid staking, especially for young blockchains.</p> <p>Curve Exploit Savior</p> <p>Q: How a 15-year-old ended up saving $6million?</p> <p>A: In crypto due to bull market, joined Pocket Network then started to build all the tooling for scratch, started with the staking company, as the infrastracture was complicated.</p> <p>Q: Elaborate on the infrastructure requirements.</p> <p>A: Pocket Network requirements for stacking are pretty complicated, as Validators have to execute the blockchain and run the RPC node, with very little public tooling. These were built from scratch based on Pocket's Goodwill and the opportunity presented itself which led him to this niche.</p> <p>Q: You started to build those kinds of services, maybe like what the challenges you faced in that period?</p> <p>A: There were a lot of challenges like balancing school and work and also wrestling in highschool that caused a lot of issues with time that needs to be adjusted weekly.</p> <p>Curve Exploit Details</p> <p>Q: Can you talk more of how this device enables itself into the Brun world?</p> <p>A: When he joined crypto market was ripping Uh and so I think there were lots of opportunities everywhere I joined the pocket Network first Um and immediately after joining it it was kind of a\u00a0a network that was growing at a very rapid rate and, so there were just lots of opportunities Um to pick up there Um we first got started started with a staking company.</p> <p>Q: When you joined the war room what did you learn and how was this whole thing set in and about the roles?</p> <p>A: The good thing is that a lot of people were involved in the communication and the specifics.</p> <p>Q: How the curve exploit was handled?</p> <p>A: He was able to revert the swap in the pool by simulating it, then find out that the internal balance was ridiculously out of whack with the actual balance, which leads to realize to donate to balance about 30k of curve currency.</p> <p>Advice and closing remarks</p> <p>Q: Any advice for these founders, that do not have the same context that you had, what are your recommendations?</p> <p>A: Having contacts with centralized exchanges, since during attacks its easy to know the frozen address.      Create an incident response plan.</p> <p>Q: To your final words what would you recommend a project to consider?</p> <p>A: I think the industry would benefit a lot if everyone moved, like 30% slower, because then everyone could like take time to do things properly      Also, there has to be a cultural shift across everyone.</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Proof%20Of%20Podcast/20240627_Zach%20Dash_%20Starting%20a%20Country/","title":"Zach Dash: Starting a Country","text":"<p>Upload Date: 20240627</p> <p>Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiDe-yOzwgE</p>"},{"location":"podcasts/Proof%20Of%20Podcast/20240627_Zach%20Dash_%20Starting%20a%20Country/#summary-of-zach-dash-starting-a-country","title":"Summary of \"Zach Dash: Starting a Country\"","text":"<p>Introduction</p> <ul> <li>Q: Could you please introduce yourself?</li> <li>A: Zachary \"Dash\" lives in Austin, Texas.
