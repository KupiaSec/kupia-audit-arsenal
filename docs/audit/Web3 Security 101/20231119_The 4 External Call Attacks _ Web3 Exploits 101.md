# The 4 External Call Attacks | Web3 Exploits 101

Hey everyone, Owen here, and in this video, we're breaking down four critical aspects to consider when interacting with untrusted external calls in Web3.

## 1. Main Points

*   **Re-entrancy:**  The classic risk where an external call leads to repeated execution of functions, potentially draining funds or leading to unexpected behavior.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The external call can cause a transaction to get stuck or not respond at all.  This is a significant issue in dApps, as it prevents expected functionality.
*   **Gas Griefing:**  External calls can be designed to consume excessive amounts of gas, making the entire transaction process incredibly expensive.
*   **Return Values:** Unexpected or improperly formatted return data from external calls leading to incorrect processing within the contract.


## 2. Key Insights

*   **Untrusted Addresses and the Risk:** The biggest takeaway is that external calls to untrusted addresses are inherently risky.  You can never fully know what type of logic or code is running on that external server.  Critically assess the nature of the call, the data being sent, and expected returns.
*   **Unexpected Outcomes:**  A significant point here is that Web3 interactions often have unexpected outcomes.  External calls often have complex logic.  Always expect the unexpected, especially when interacting with an untrusted address. This is very useful knowledge.
*   **Gas Limits:** Understand that gas limits aren't just for cost consideration. They can prevent DOS attacks by limiting how much the external function can consume.
*   **Non-Reentrancy Modifiers (and their limits):**  These exist in complex systems to control re-entry attempts, but it's important to understand their limitations. Depending on the implementation, a significant DoS attack could occur if not careful. The global non - reentrancy modifier provides a crucial layer of safeguard.

## 3. Practical Takeaways

*   **Thorough Security Audits:**   Before making any external calls, conduct a thorough security audit of the smart contracts involved, and external services calling back in.
*   **Gas Limits and Rate Limits:**  Implement appropriate gas limits and rate limits to prevent DoS and gas griefing attacks. Monitor external calls carefully to understand what they do and avoid problems.
*   **Input Validation:**  Be sure to thoroughly validate input and return data, including the type and format. This helps prevent unexpected system failures and malformed data.
*   **Community Engagement:**  Be part of a community of security researchers to stay updated on the latest attack vectors and effective strategies.


## 4. Additional Notes

*   **This was a long video.**  It covered a lot of ground from basic principles like reentrance to more nuanced aspects like gas handling and return values.
*    **Practical Examples:**  This video could benefit from explicit code examples of external calls and the various potential problems.

Hopefully, this breakdown is helpful!  Remember, security is paramount in Web3.
