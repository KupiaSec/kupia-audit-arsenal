# 4 Steps To Become A Master Security Researcher

Hey everyone,

This video is about four key steps to become a top-tier security researcher.  It's not a simple path, but if you follow through, you absolutely can achieve it.


## 1. Main Points

*   **Understand the fundamentals of the codebase.** This is the foundation of any security research.
*   **Read code and understand its purpose and flow.** Identifying each component and their function in the code is crucial for pinpointing vulnerabilities.
*   **Identify and learn common exploits and vulnerabilities.**  A vast body of knowledge is already available; learning from it and understanding common patterns is a major timesaver.
*   **Practice, Practice, Practice.** The best way to get better at something is to do it regularly.

## 2. Key Insights

My experience shows that becoming a master security researcher takes time.  It's not a sprint but a marathon.  You need to build up understanding and intuition over time, just like learning to ride a bike starts with falls and struggles.  The crucial insight is understanding that, if you diligently invest this time in learning the fundamental types of vulnerabilities and how they're exploited, you will eventually reach a point where you can spot them quickly and with deep understanding. The more codebases you audit, the sharper your intuition becomes, allowing you to detect even subtle weaknesses effectively.  Moreover, focusing on a specific protocol or codebase can greatly accelerate your progress, enabling a deep understanding of its mechanics.


## 3. Practical Takeaways

*   **Become deeply familiar with Solidity through writing a lot of code.**  Start building your own code and understand the constructs deeply before you move to auditing.
*   **Devour a wide breadth of codebases and scrutinize them from a security perspective.**  Look for patterns and familiarize yourself with different approaches in solid smart contract design.
*   **Seek out and learn about common vulnerabilities and their exploits.** Resources like the work of top security researchers are invaluable in learning about common pitfalls and trends in vulnerability discovery.
*   **Commit to consistent security analysis and training.** It's an ongoing journey, demanding continuous effort and refinement.  Committing to daily practice is crucial.

## 4. Additional Notes

Focus on understanding *why* a vulnerability is present rather than just memorizing the pattern. This deep understanding translates directly to efficiency and a superior capability to locate vulnerabilities in various codebases.  The more time you dedicate to learning and practicing, the more your intuition and working capacity will grow, making your work *effortless* over time. Continuous learning from others' experiences is also essential to gaining a broader perspective and faster growth.
