# 22 Vulnerabilities I Use To Find Criticals FAST!

Hey everyone,

This video dives into 22 vulnerabilities I commonly utilize to quickly find critical issues in code.  Let's get into it:

## 1. Main Points

*   **Comprehensive List:** I'm outlining 22 different attack vectors.
*   **Focus on Efficiency:** The vulnerabilities are chosen for their speed in revealing critical flaws.
*   **Detailed Explanation:** Each vulnerability is discussed in depth in a separate video (implied by the closing statement).

## 2. Key Insights

I've identified recurring patterns in how vulnerabilities are introduced, misused, or exploited. I'm focusing on these patterns to quickly spot critical weaknesses.  This isn't just about detecting flaws; it's about understanding the *why* behind them.  My goal is to provide tangible insights beyond just identifying bug locations.  The insights come from extensive experience reviewing smart contract code and identifying trends and patterns of attack in codebases. By understanding the thought process and methodology of a malicious actor, you can improve the robustness of your smart contract code. I'm looking specifically for recurring patterns in vulnerabilities and how they can target code weaknesses.  The focus isn't just on the vulnerability itself, but the motivations and methods behind the attempts.

## 3. Practical Takeaways

*   **Expand Your Toolkit:** Learn about these 22 attack vectors.
*   **Proactive Defense:**  Understanding attack methods will help you to build more resilient contracts.
*   **Iterative Improvement:**  Continue to learn and adapt your approach based on evolving vulnerabilities.


## 4. Additional Notes

This is just the introduction/overview video. Each of the individual vulnerabilities will be discussed individually and shown in practice to reveal the "how" from my previous explanation. This is not an exhaustive list but a selection of common and relevant vulnerabilities to focus on for both new programmers and experienced ones.  I've attempted to identify and categorize these attacks based on consistent patterns. The goal is to give you a deeper understanding rather than a surface-level analysis. Further, this information is crucial for those involved in security audit roles or those writing smart contract code on their own.
