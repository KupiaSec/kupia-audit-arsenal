# Sandwich Attacks | Web3 Exploits 101

Hey everyone, I'm Owen.  In this video, we're diving deep into sandwich attacks, a specific type of exploit in the Web3 world.

## 1. Main Points

*   **Understanding the mechanics of Sandwich Attacks:**  These exploits leverage the vulnerabilities in decentralized exchanges (DEXs).
*   **Dissecting arbitrage opportunities:**  The core concept is to exploit price discrepancies between different DEXs.
*   **How sandwich attacks work from the attacker's perspective:**  Attackers use multiple transactions to maximize profits from price fluctuations.
*   **Protecting yourself and your assets:**  Key strategies for mitigating risks and preventing losses.
*   **Illustrative examples:**  I'm using specific cases and diagrams to explain the concept of a sandwich contract.
*   **The importance of front-running:**  The attacker strategically executes their transactions before the user's, creating an arbitrage situation.
*   **How slippage tolerances impact outcomes:** The way slippage is managed by protocol/DEXs can influence the severity of the attacks; sometimes slippage is unacceptably large.
*   **Illustrative code:** Demonstrating realistic situations that lead to exploits.
*   **Mitigating risks:** Exploring real-world examples and the importance of rigorous smart contract audits.


## 2. Key Insights

This isn't just some theoretical threat—sandwich attacks have caused real financial harm to users, extracting millions of dollars.  A key insight is the complex interaction between the user's transactions and those of the attacker.  It's not just about the quick arbitrage.  The attacker is literally "sandwishing" the user's transaction between two of their own, exploiting the system's lack of real-time price synchronization. Another crucial insight is how carefully a system must be designed to handle high-volume or fast-moving transactions, especially the handling of slippage.  Ultimately, the exploit revolves around exploiting weaknesses in how the system handles these order books.  We need to understand that while exchanges exist to execute transactions, the complexity of multiple transactions crossing the order book can lead to exploits like Sandwich attacks.  Think of it as an extremely clever and sophisticated type of front-running.  The slippage tolerance built into the systems plays a pivotal role in preventing or mitigating these attacks.

## 3. Practical Takeaways

*   **Educate yourself:**  Understand the fundamentals of how DEXs operate, especially the arbitrage opportunities and potential vulnerabilities to sandwich attacks.
*   **Engage with security research:**  Pay attention to analysis from security researchers—there's a need to understand how the current smart contracts are operating.
*   **Use security-minded wallets and DEXs:**  Prioritize wallets and DEXs with proven security measures and auditing capabilities.
*   **Be cautious when trading in high-volume or fast-moving markets:**  The risk of slippage becomes exponentially higher in these situations and may need extra attention to avoid a big loss.
*   **Front-run your transactions:** Understand how arbitrage works and is used in sandwich attacks and front-running.


## 4. Additional Notes

This video is designed to be a comprehensive overview; the technical elements are dissected in detail—to give you practical knowledge.  More in-depth resources are valuable for continued learning. Further videos from Guardian Audits and others can give more detailed examination. I believe understanding the basics of arbitrage and how different systems handle transaction order books is paramount before you start to build or use these protocols yourself. Understanding the different types of sandwich attacks and how they're executed is key to protecting yourself from or potentially uncovering these scenarios.
