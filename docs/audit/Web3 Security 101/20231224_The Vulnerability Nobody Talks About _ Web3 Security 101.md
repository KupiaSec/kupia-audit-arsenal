# The Vulnerability Nobody Talks About | Web3 Security 101

Hey everyone, Owen here.  In this video, I'm diving into a specific type of Web3 vulnerability class that, frankly, isn't talked about enough.  It's something I've been uncovering for years through Guardian Audits.

## 1. Main Points

*   **Stepwise Jumps:** This vulnerability class isn't about massive, obvious breaches; it's about subtle, incremental problems with how smart contracts manage rewards or updates.
*   **Hidden in Smart Contracts:** These vulnerabilities often manifest in seemingly simple codebases but have significant consequences.
*   **Impact on Users:** The cumulative effect of these stepwise jumps can hurt many users over time.
*   **Types of Vulnerabilities:**  I'll introduce examples of three key ways this pattern of incremental changes can create high-severity vulnerabilities in popular smart contracts.

## 2. Key Insights

This isn't just a theoretical problem.  The hidden nature of these issues means they can be present in widely used protocols without anybody noticing.  One key insight is that these stepwise jumps can create problems in the value, distribution of rewards, or other calculations over time.  Imagine a reward per share rate that changes subtly, but repeatedly, often unnoticed. At first, the impact might be negligible, but over many transactions, the cumulative effect can be a significant loss or an unexpected gain for certain (or malicious) users.  A malicious entity could manipulate the logic in subtle ways leading to unintended outcomes.  Many of these attacks are subtle. These flaws are often concealed within functions tied to reward distribution, staking, or unstaking. It's precisely because they're subtle, and their effects often compound over time, that they don't get discussed or flagged as often as more straightforward security risks.  Critically, often, the effect of these types of attacks can be seen directly in the graphs of the reward systems.

Essentially, a careful audit will reveal a stepwise jump in the reward rate.  This could drastically impact the overall balance of the system and, worse, provide a clear path toward unintended results.

## 3. Practical Takeaways

*   **Thorough Audits:** Always conduct thorough smart contract audits, particularly for protocols relying on stepwise reward mechanisms. Understand how reward distribution and calculation logic work. Check how balance is calculated and how changes affect the total value and distribution of tokens.
*   **Deep Dive Analysis:** Don't just rely on surface-level reviews; a crucial analysis should delve deeply into the behavior over time within smart contract logic. Visualize the reward mechanisms as a timeline with different conditions to understand gradual changesâ€”this is where issues can manifest and reveal significant vulnerabilities.
*   **Transparency of Systems:** If possible, examine the transaction history and flow throughout the smart contract. Understand how other users can affect this system or the result of different transactions on one another.
*   **Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing:** It's essential to share knowledge about these types of vulnerabilities. The more smart contract auditors become familiar with them, the better protocols will be designed. The Web3 community as a whole can improve by recognizing these flaws.

## 4. Additional Notes

This is a complex issue, and I've only scratched the surface here. My goal in presenting these types of problems isn't to scare people, but to create awareness and help the community build better, more secure Web3 protocols.  In the video description below this video, I'll post resources, including a six-step guide to becoming a senior smart contract auditor.  Pay attention to the transaction history and flows in the code to detect patterns.
