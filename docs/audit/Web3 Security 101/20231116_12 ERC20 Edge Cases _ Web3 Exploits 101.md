# 12 ERC20 Edge Cases | Web3 Exploits 101

Hey everyone, this is Owen, and I'm here to talk about 12 ERC20 edge cases â€“ essentially, common vulnerabilities found in ERC20 token implementations.

## 1. Main Points

*   There are 12 specific edge cases in ERC20 token implementations that can lead to exploits.
*   Each edge case presents a different type of vulnerability or behavior.
*   These edge cases can lead to unexpected token behavior and security issues, such as re-entrancy.
*   A security review is often needed to uncover implementations of these edge cases.
*   These edge cases are important to know to improve contract security and reduce the risk of financial loss.


## 2. Key Insights

My key insight is that the community needs to be aware of these edge cases because while many popular tokens (like USDT) are relatively safe, there's always a chance that a poorly designed token or protocol can lead to significant financial losses.  Knowing these edge cases isn't just about the theoretical; it's about practical security implications in everyday Web3 use.  We're not just looking at potential exploits in isolation; we're looking at how specific implementation choices can lead to them in real-world scenarios. This video dives deep into 12 distinct edge cases, which each could unlock a unique and sometimes subtle exploit.  There's risk in *any* token. A security review or audit is paramount in order to check if these vulnerabilities will arise. Some edge cases relate specifically to how the token interacts with the blockchain when a transaction goes wrong, while others are related to unusual design choices. The details are important. Many problems arise because smart contract authors don't account for what happens when a transaction fails mid-execution.


## 3. Practical Takeaways

*   **Don't assume:**  Never assume a token is safe.  Conduct your due diligence, whether it's through security audits, community research, or other means.
*   **Pay attention to details:**  The specifics of token implementations play a crucial role. Subtle design flaws or incomplete treatment of unusual transaction scenarios can dramatically affect security.
*   **Learn from the examples**: The 12 cases highlighted in this video illustrate diverse vulnerabilities, offering valuable learning experiences.
*   **Use appropriate tooling:** Utilizing security analysis tools, particularly those that analyze code for ERC20-related issues, can identify these problems automatically.
*   **Share knowledge:** This knowledge is crucial for the entire community, facilitating safer token development and improved protocols.


## 4. Additional Notes

This isn't just academic. These 12 ERC20 edge cases represent very real vulnerabilities.  My personal experience has shown how prevalent these subtle issues are in many contracts, and therefore these need to be addressed. By bringing greater awareness to these edge cases, we're collectively bolstering Web3 security and ensuring a healthier ecosystem, preventing costly mistakes.
