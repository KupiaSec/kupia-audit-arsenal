# 21 Sneaky Smart Contract Bugs - Video Summary

Hey everyone, Owen here from Guardian Audits.  In this video, Iâ€™m breaking down 21 sneaky smart contract bugs that I see repeatedly in audits.

## 1. Main Points

*   **Detailed analysis of 21 common smart contract vulnerabilities.**  These are not trivial issues; they have real-world implications.
*   **Practical examples of each bug.** Demonstrating how they manifest in code.
*   **Explanations of the root causes.**  Delving into why these bugs happen.
*   **Practical guidance on preventing these issues.**  Showing how to identify and avoid similar mistakes.


## 2. Key Insights

*   **Not all bugs are created equal.** Some vulnerabilities are more niche but still critical.  Understanding the differing levels of criticality is vital in auditing.
*   **Understanding the subtleties of Solidity.** The nuances of Solidity's syntax and behavior play a huge role in creating complex bugs that can be overlooked.
*   **Emphasis on detailed analysis.**  Thorough examination of every line of smart contract code is crucial.  Many subtle errors can lead to major security flaws.
*   **Preventative measures over reactive remediation.**  Proactively looking for vulnerabilities in contract designs is much more effective than trying to patch problems after they've been deployed.


## 3. Practical Takeaways

*   **Review every interaction carefully.**  Ensure every function call, transfer of value, and bit manipulation operation is thoroughly scrutinized.
*   **Pay close attention to loops and iterations.**  Smart contracts that use loops, especially those with non-obvious termination conditions, warrant rigorous scrutiny.
*   **Handle edge cases meticulously.** Ensure that error conditions and boundary cases are considered.
*   **Leverage the expertise and information available.** For any problems or concerns with contract auditing, utilize resources like Guardian Audits' website and community for best practices.
*   **Use established security libraries.**  Leveraging existing, vetted libraries like "safe casting" from OpenZeppelin can greatly reduce the risk of common vulnerabilities.



## 4. Additional Notes

This video is part of a series, emphasizing ongoing learning and security practices.  My goal is to empower blockchain engineers with the knowledge to create secure smart contracts and to help identify vulnerabilities before they become exploitable. Please leave comments below with any questions or relevant bugs you've encountered.
