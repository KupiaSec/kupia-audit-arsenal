# POC Writing Guide - Summary from My Perspective

1. **Main Points**

*   Understanding the purpose of a Proof of Concept (POC).
*   Identifying the problem or vulnerability you want to address.
*   Creating a concise example to demonstrate the concept.
*   Focusing on clear and concise code.
*   Documenting the POC clearly for others.
*   Prioritizing the problem being addressed in your POC.
*   Detailing different scenarios showcasing how the POC functions correctly and potentially incorrectly.
*   Using logging to track the steps and outcomes during the POC execution.
*   Building a testing harness for rigorous verification.
*   Keeping the POC's scope narrowly focused on the specific problem, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
*   Explaining the results of the POC in detail and demonstrating actionable steps.


2. **Key Insights**

*   A POC isn't about creating a fully functional product. It's about validating a concept or idea, proving that a proposed solution is feasible and that your idea will work in practice.  Focus on the core logic and avoid wasted effort on extras.
*   Thorough testing is crucial: Demonstrate the functionality of your POC in a variety of scenarios.  Identify edge cases, failure states, and all the ways your idea could be deployed in the real world to account for any issues that may not be obvious from limited testing.
*   Effective logging is key to understanding the outcome and for debugging and refinement.  Detailed logs enable tracing the code's progress during execution, helping spot any unexpected steps or potential problems, and allow you to document and present your findings methodically and with precision.


3. **Practical Takeaways**

*   Devise a scenario or problem your POC aims to solve.
*   Create a simplified, minimal representation of this scenario within the POC code. Be explicit about what problems you are solving, and stick to the core issues, rather than solving related ones.
*   Develop clear, well-commented source code that accurately represents your concept.  Use well-structured code and comments detailing each step and decision in your POC to help clarity.
*   Use a testing framework to cover as many realistic scenarios as possible, including failure conditions, to check for edge cases and to help provide a holistic perspective on issues, validating your idea in a variety of contexts.
*   Document every step, decision, and outcome clearly in your POC's methodology, so you can explain and present all the process's details, in a comprehensible way.  A well-documented POC is critical for understanding the results.
*   Be prepared to iterate on your POC.  The initial version might not be perfect; the testing process may reveal flaws or unexpected behaviors.  Be ready to adjust your code based on insights gained from testing, to address shortcomings in all contexts.
*   Clearly articulate the results of your POC to others; it aims to validate your hypothesis, enabling you to demonstrate the potential effectiveness of a solution in practice.


4. **Additional Notes**

*   The video emphasizes the importance of good logging for debugging and documentation. Logging crucial details during testing can greatly aid in identifying and explaining flaws in implementation, which allows you to create a well-rounded presentation of findings.
*   The video strongly implies a focus on problem-solving using a practical and testable approach to ensure the solution is robust and thoroughly validated.  This practical approach to problem solving is very important, to show the POC's use and functionality.
*   The POC's scope should be minimal and well-defined, focusing exclusively on the core problem. This helps keep the POC concise and focused on the essential features.


Implementing these steps will help you create effective POCs that clearly and efficiently demonstrate the feasibility and viability of your ideas.
