# Get Into The Attacker's Mindset

1. **Main Points**

*   Understanding the attacker's mindset is crucial for effective security analysis.
*   Offensive thinking is key to uncovering vulnerabilities.
*   There are four key steps to adopting the attacker's mindset.
*   Incentivizing oneself to find as many vulnerabilities as possible is essential.
*   Distrust of developers and constantly questioning assumptions and protocols is important.
*   Collecting knobs (critical aspects of the codebase) and combining them for more sophisticated exploits is essential.

2. **Key Insights**

*   **Shifting Perspective:** The video emphasizes the importance of adopting the attacker's perspective rather than the defensive one.  This isn't about becoming malicious, but about understanding the strategies and thought processes of an attacker to identify potential vulnerabilities better.

*   **Finding Vulnerabilities, Not Just Verifying Security:**  A defensive mindset often focuses on verifying existing security, while an attacker mindset focuses on breaking it intentionally.  This approach leads to more comprehensive vulnerability discovery.

*   **Incentivizing the Search:**  The pursuit of vulnerabilities is often enhanced by personal incentives, such as the "reward" of finding them.  This is a powerful motivator, encouraging a more thorough and active search.

*   **Recognizing Subtleties:** Key insights in the video describe avoiding common mistakes made in security analysis by questioning assumptions and carefully considering every detail in the system.  This often exposes vulnerabilities that might otherwise be missed.

3. **Practical Takeaways**

* **Framework for Auditing:**  Follow the four steps discussed in the video to audit the codebase from an attacker's perspective. This systematic approach will result in a much more effective scan.

*   **Distrust and Questioning:**  Don't automatically assume the code is secure. Question every aspect, every function, and every interaction. Push for the potential ways the code can be exploited.

*   **Incentivize Yourself:**  Establish clear goals and incentives for yourself during the audit process. This encourages a more diligent and efficient approach.

* **Teamwork:**  Consider the benefit of working with a team of security professionals who have different viewpoints and perspectives when auditing a codebase.


4. **Additional Notes**

The video extensively analyzes the GMX V2 smart contract, using the principles of an attacker mindset to demonstrate how vulnerabilities can be identified. Further information on specific exploits is discussed throughout the video and can be a helpful resource for learning. This context makes the speaker's methodology more tangible.  The speaker (Owen, of Guardian Audits), clearly has significant experience in smart contract auditing, which adds weight to the advice given.
