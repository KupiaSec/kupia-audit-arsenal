# Front-Running Attacks | Web3 Exploits 101

Hey everyone,

This video dives into the world of front-running attacks in Web3.  Let's break down the key concepts.

## 1. Main Points

* Front-running attacks are a common exploit in smart contract systems.
* They involve taking advantage of transaction ordering in the mempool.
* These attacks can be applied to any codebase and can lead to bugs and vulnerabilities.
* Understanding the mempool, transaction ordering, and gas pricing is crucial.


## 2. Key Insights

My video discusses the underlying mechanics of how these front-running attacks work. The core problem is that the mempool is a first-come, first-served queue of transactions.  If someone can see the transactions in the mempool *before* they're included in a block, then they have the ability to potentially influence that transaction's execution.

Essentially, transaction ordering before it gets finalized on the blockchain is influenced by gas pricing. Knowing that, a malicious actor can analyze the gas prices of different users' transactions sitting in the mempool. This allows them to "front-run" these transactions, submitting their own with higher priority fees to get recorded earlier. This can lead to a variety of negative outcomes, such as stealing rewards or taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities against the user.

In the video, I illustrate with clear examples how a front-running attack can be used. This includes demonstrating how a transaction ordering can cause changes to the value of a token.

## 3. Practical Takeaways

* **Understand transaction ordering:** A key skill for any blockchain developer or security researcher is analyzing how transactions are ordered in the mempool. This is important when designing smart contracts or analyzing a protocol for security issues.
* **Monitor mempool:** Use tools such as EtherScan gas trackers to observe pending transaction behaviour and look for any patterns of anomalous activity.
* **Stay updated on security:** Stay informed about new attack vectors and constantly develop your knowledge to ensure your smart contracts are protected.
* **Use proper security reviews:** Regularly test smart contracts for front-running issues to avoid vulnerabilities that can lead to financial losses or other negative consequences.


## 4. Additional Notes

In this video, I've shared insights based on my experience co-founding Guardian Audits over a year and a half, and auditing hundreds of smart contracts to identify common vulnerabilities along the way. My goal with each video is to distill down complex information into a format that's easier to understand to help you become a better Web3 developer, security researcher, or learner overall.

This is just a starting point. Front running attacks can be extremely sophisticated with malicious actors being able to modify various variables. Continued learning and exploration are paramount to combat these challenges. Stay tuned for future videos breaking down other Web3 exploits!
