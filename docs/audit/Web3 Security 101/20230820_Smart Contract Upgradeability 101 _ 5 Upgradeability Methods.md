# Smart Contract Upgradeability 101 | 5 Upgradeability Methods

Hey everyone, Owen here.  In this video, we're diving into smart contract upgradeability, a crucial topic for modern blockchain development.

1. **Main Points**

*   Smart contracts are becoming more prevalent.
*   This prevalence brings an increased risk of various vulnerabilities.
*   We'll overview five different methods of smart contract upgradeability.
*   We'll examine potential mishaps and vulnerabilities related to each upgradeability pattern.
*   We'll discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method.


2. **Key Insights**

*   **Upgradability is essential**: As smart contracts become more complex and need to evolve or add functionality, upgradeability mitigates the numerous risks that come with these updates.
*   **Five main strategies**:  The methods discussed cover a range of complexity and trade-offs.  Each approach has unique pros and cons, so the best choice depends on the specific needs of your smart contract project. 
*   **Vulnerabilities**:  Upgrading a smart contract can introduce unforeseen vulnerabilities if not handled correctly.  Potential issues discussed include misconfigurations, incorrect code deployment, conflicts, and security gaps.
*   **Focus on security**:  Proper upgradeability mechanisms minimize the risk of introducing unintended vulnerabilities and allow for more gradual and secure evolution of your smart contracts. 
*   **The Diamond Standard**:  One method, the Diamond Standard, is presented as a more versatile and robust option for handling complex contract upgrades, presenting a modular and secure means of handling a large number of functions within a smart contract. 


3. **Practical Takeaways**

*   **Research and choose wisely**: When designing your smart contracts, deeply consider the upgradeability methods and choose the one best suited for your project.
*   **Thorough audits**:  A crucial takeaway emphasized is the necessity to perform thorough audits on the chosen upgradeability method to ensure no vulnerabilities are introduced during the process. 
*   **Understanding vulnerabilities**: The discussion highlights the crucial importance of understanding likely vulnerabilities in your chosen plan to help avoid problems.
*   **The choice is crucial**: The right upgrade method is important for maximizing efficiency, minimizing risk, and facilitating a smooth evolution of your smart contract. 
*   **Community engagement**: Look for assistance from the community and experts.


4. **Additional Notes**

This video provides a comprehensive explanation of the complexities of smart contract upgradeability. The concepts discussed include delegate call, transparent proxies, and internal storage management.  Understanding and carefully considering these mechanisms are essential for creating robust and secure decentralized applications.  I encourage further inquiry and research for further insight.
