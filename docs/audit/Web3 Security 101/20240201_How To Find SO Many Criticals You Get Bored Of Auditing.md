# How To Find SO Many Criticals You Get Bored Of Auditing

Hey everyone,

This video outlines a method, which I like to call the GTDA method, for finding critical bugs during security audits.

## 1. Main Points

*   **Introducing the GTDA method:**  A systematic approach to security auditing, specifically for blockchain protocols.
*   **Comprehensive audit process:** The video lays out the steps of the GTDA method, focusing on different stages and techniques.
*   **Importance of a systematic approach:** The key takeaway is that a structured method, beyond just memorization, is necessary for effective identification of bugs.
*   **Addressing Common Misunderstandings:** The presentation aims to correct common misperceptions about security auditing, particularly concerning the expected processes and expected kinds of bugs.
*   **Practical application:** Demonstrates how to implement and apply the GTDA method in various situations.
*   **Community focus:** Encourages the audience to interact with the community and share notes for further development.

## 2. Key Insights

My GTDA method isn't about rote memorization, but a deeper understanding of how the code and protocol operate.  It takes time to implement, but the payoff is worth it.

*   **First-pass context:**  Starting with a broad understanding of the overall codebase and protocol.  What are its design goals? What problems is it trying to solve?
*   **Detailed analysis of each component:**  GTDA method focuses on breaking down the code base into smaller, manageable parts.  We need to look for logical errors and edge cases that a purely automated approach may miss.
*   **Importance of diagrams:** Visual representations become critical.  Diagrams can help visualize interactions, potential vulnerabilities, and the overall flow.
*   **Using tools and resources wisely:**  Utilizing readily available tools like readmes and other users' documentation is essential.  We don't need to reinvent the wheel for every codebase.  Understanding the expected behaviour is important.
*   **Teamwork and feedback:** A team approach amplifies knowledge and experience.  Sharing findings and perspectives enhances the auditing process.
*   **Realistic expectations:** Auditing isn't about rote memorization; it's about understanding the core logic and function of the codebase.


## 3. Practical Takeaways

*   **Structured approach:**  Plan your audit process using the GTDA method.
*   **Time management:** Allocate time for understanding context, detailed component analysis, and use diagrams.
*   **Community engagement:** Use forums and shared documents to increase efficiency.
*   **Use tools effectively:**  Employ various documentation and readily available resources to expedite the process.
*   **Continuous learning:**  Adapt and adjust your approach to specific protocols and vulnerabilities.
*   **Teamwork:**  Collaborate with others to improve auditing understanding and efficiency.

## 4. Additional Notes

This GTDA method isn't just a set of steps, it's a way of approaching security, so you can apply it to other projects.  Building a comprehensive toolbox helps you to efficiently and effectively find complex security vulnerabilities, ensuring the success of your audits.  The core is learning from others, both from those who successfully audit and those who make the errors, especially reentrancy attacks, the most obvious ones and the most important ones to look for.


This isn't exhaustive,  as much can be discussed in a much greater detail in future videos, or through follow-up questions from your comments.
