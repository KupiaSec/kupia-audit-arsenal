# Is This A Critical? How To Rank Vulnerability Severity

Hey everyone,

This video is about vulnerability ranking and classification.  As you'll see, it's a complex process.

## 1. Main Points

*   Vulnerability ranking is a subjective process, without a single, universally accepted method.
*   Assessing vulnerability severity involves considering impact and probability.
*   Different factors influence the severity of vulnerabilities, which are often granular and unique.
*   There are different perspectives on vulnerability ranking, and these vary depending on the context and the specific protocol in question.

## 2. Key Insights

My experience shows that vulnerability ranking is not a simple, formulaic approach. Each vulnerability presents unique circumstances that impact its potential severity, based on an individual protocol's properties.  It's influenced by factors such as:

*   **Impact:** The potential damage a successful attack could cause, impacting users and/or the protocol. This could range from minor inconvenience, to significant financial loss.
*   **Probability:** The likelihood that an attack will be successful given vulnerability's context. This is highly variable and can vary depending on the potential attacker's skills and resources.
*   **Protocol Context:** Different smart contracts have different mechanisms and functionality, which in turn modify the impact and probability of vulnerabilities. Factors such as use of multisigs, the availability of liquidations,  and the potential for griefing all heavily influence vulnerability severity.

By evaluating the impact and probability of a specific vulnerability within a particular smart contract implementation, a more accurate ranking can be achieved.


## 3. Practical Takeaways

1.  **Understand the specific protocol:**  Before ranking a vulnerability, thoroughly comprehend how the protocol functions and what mechanisms are in place.
2.  **Analyze impact and probability:**  Consider the potential damage that an exploit could cause and the likelihood of that exploit becoming successful.
3.  **Seek diverse perspectives:**  Involve other security researchers to get different viewpoints for a comprehensive and complete analysis of vulnerability characteristics.
4.  **Consider the context:**  Recognize that vulnerability impact and probability are contingent upon the unique circumstances of the smart contract, current market conditions, and the capabilities of potential attackers.
5.  **Continuously evaluate:** Smart contract vulnerabilities and their potential risks are not static; therefore, security evaluations should not be performed in a silo or one time only exercise.  Continuous audits are essential.


## 4. Additional Notes

I've personally identified four buckets for smart contract security analysis: low, medium, high, and critical. However, this approach is not universal.  The precise severity rating often depends on many complex factors and may even differ between different teams of security professionals. It also emphasized the subjective nature of the task and the need for careful consideration of varying security contexts.  The analysis needs to be revisited over time and context as new information evolves.
