We've carefully curated the best security wisdom from across Web3, organizing it so you can find exactly what you need when you need it:

### üîç Audit Section
Ever wondered how to think like a top-tier auditor? Our audit section features comprehensive notes from **Owen of GuardianAudit's Web3 Security 101 videos**.

From liquidity pools to flash loans, from yield farming to governance mechanisms - we've got the technical foundations covered so you can spot when something doesn't look right.
