# Yearn Finance and YFI Token Explained: A Deep Dive into DeFi Yield Optimization

Yearn Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol on Ethereum aiming to maximize yield for its users through automation and optimization strategies. Essentially, it's a yield optimizer.

## What is Yearn Finance?

The core of Yearn Finance is the **Yearn protocol (Yearn Iron)**, which acts as a yield optimizer. This protocol automatically shifts user funds between various lending protocols (like Compound, Aave, and others) to find the highest Annual Percentage Yield (APY) for stablecoins.

### Andre Cronje and the Genesis of Yearn

In early 2020, Andre Cronje, the author of the Yearn protocol, sought to automate his process of selecting the highest-paying lending protocol for his stablecoins. He coded the first version of the Yearn protocol to automate the entire yield optimization process.

In the first iteration, Andre had to manually check for the best APY every day and move his funds accordingly. This manual work became repetitive and boring, and he started coding the first version of the Yearn protocol to automate the whole process, selecting the most optimal strategy for his stablecoins.

### How Yearn Works

The protocol creates a pool for each stablecoin. Users deposit their stablecoins into these pools and receive **yTokens** in return. These yTokens are yield-bearing equivalents of the deposited coin. For example, depositing DAI gives you yDAI. The protocol then moves the funds across different lending protocols to maximize yield.

For instance, if Aave offers a better yield on DAI than Compound, the Yearn protocol can decide to move all or some of the DAI to Aave. Conversely, The protocol checks if there is a better yield available before a user deposits or withdraws money from the pool, thus triggering a rebalance of the pool if necessary. However, the protocol assures that it will never swap initially deposited stable coins for a diffrent one, even if there is a higher yield available in the other side.

## Vaults: More Advanced Strategies

Yearn vaults are essentially pools of funds with an associated strategy for maximizing returns on the asset. These strategies are more active than simply lending out coins and can involve:

*   Farming other tokens and selling them for profit.
*   Providing liquidity.
*   Borrowing stablecoins.

Each vault follows a strategy voted in by the Yearn community. With the introduction of liquidity mining (popularized by Compound's COMP token distribution), yield farming became more complex. Andre and the Yearn community started working on "Vaults." "Vaults" are pools of funds with an associated strategy for maximizing returns on the asset. The default Vault strategies are more active than just lending coins.

## YFI Token: Governance and Decentralization

To further decentralize the Yearn protocol, Andre Cronje distributed a governance token, YFI, to the Yearn community. The YFI token had no pre-mine, no Venture Capital (VC) allocation, and no team reward â€” every token was distributed to users of the protocol.

The distribution focused on a fair launch and rewarding the Yearn community. YFI tokens were distributed to the liquidity providers (LPs) on select platforms during the token distribution period.

### The Value of YFI

The YFI token rapidly appreciated in value, reflecting the protocol's growth and the increasing amount of value locked within its ecosystem. It gives holders the ability to vote and shape the future direction of the Yearn Finance protocol.

### Addressing Risk: Multi-Sig Key

The initial single admin key held by Andre Cronje posed a risk. This was quickly addressed by changing it to a multi-signature key, requiring multiple signers from the DeFi community. The new key requires multiple signers from the DeFi community which eliminates most of the risks with its decentralized model.

## Yearn Ecosystem

While yield optimization remains core, Yearn has expanded to offer other services, including:

*   ySwap
*   yTrade
*   yBorrow
*   yInsure

These services are outside the scope of this video, but are accessible, with links put in the description box below on YouTube.

## Conclusion

Yearn Finance is a leading DeFi protocol, offering automated yield optimization strategies. However, understanding the associated risks before using any DeFi protocol is crucial and deciding a particular protocol requires proper research and awareness.
