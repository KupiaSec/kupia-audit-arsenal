# Is Sushi the Most Underrated Protocol in DeFi? A Deep Dive into BentoBox, Kashi, and Miso

Launched in August 2020, during the DeFi summer, Sushi (formerly SushiSwap) quickly gained traction by forking Uniswap V2 and incentivizing liquidity providers to migrate through a "vampire attack." While its launch was rocky, the team has been hard at work delivering new features and building the Sushi ecosystem.

Beyond the decentralized exchange functionality, Sushi offers a growing range of products. These are key to understanding why many believe Sushi is undervalued.

## Sushi's Key Features:

### 1. Decentralized Exchange (DEX):
The core functionality allows users to swap assets in a decentralized and permissionless manner.  It's essentially a fork of Uniswap V2, functioning in nearly the identical manner. Users can exchange one crypto asset for another. Sushi implements a profit-sharing mechanism, benefiting Sushi token holders. 0.25% of trading fees go to liquidity providers, while 0.05% are distributed to Sushi token holders who stake their tokens in the SushiBar.

### 2. SushiBar (xSushi):
Staking Sushi tokens in the SushiBar lets holders earn a portion of the trading fees. By staking `SUSHI` token into `SushiBar` smart contract, users will receive `xSUSHI`. This token gives composability and voting rights in Sushi governance. The yield on the SushiBar depends on the trading volume through the Sushi AMM and is directly proportional to the user's share of the SushiBar, and the `xSUSHI` tokens can also be added to xSushi-ETH liquidity pool for stacked yield

### 3. Onsen: Liquidity Bootstrapping
Onsen provides liquidity incentives to new projects. Selected projects receive a *sushi* allocation to incentivize liquidity provisioning for their own tokens. This reduces the need for novel projects to distribute tokens via liquidity mining independently, lowering the barrier to entry while bolstering liquidity. Swap fees from the Onsen-enabled pools are also distributed to xSushi holders, which benefits overall ecosystem. Projects are chosen on their quality and demand, while the time being in Onsen-menu can be variant.

### 4. BentoBox: A Versatile Vault
BentoBox is a special smart contract that acts as a vault for certain tokens that can be used by Bento-enabled applications in the Sushi ecosystem.  This vault enables users to earn extra yield on their tokens. BentoBox vaults generate yield in multiple ways, including flash loans and secured lending.

## BentoBox Architecture Benefits:

*   **Gas Efficiency:** Applications operating on the same vault require fewer steps.
*   **Flexibility:** Allows for multiple yield-generating strategies.

Kashi is the first available Bento-enabled application.

### 5. Kashi: Isolated Lending and Margin Trading
Kashi, meaning “landing” in Japanese, is Sushi's lending and margin trading solution, powered by BentoBox. Unlike other DeFi money markets like Aave or Compound, Kashi isolates each market. This allows anyone to create customized and gas-efficient lending and borrowing markets.  This also enables creation of markets for more risky assets without threatening solvency of whole protocol, while this comes that there should be a reliable price oracle.

### Understanding Kashi's Isolated Markets:

*   **Risk Mitigation:** Creates markets for more risky assets without impacting overall protocol solvency.
*   **Shorting Ability:** Borrowing an asset allows for shorting opportunities.
*   **Hedging:** Provides hedging capabilities for yield farming risky assets.

### 6. Miso: Token Launchpad
Miso is a token launchpad platform designed to facilitate launching new tokens on Sushi. Miso focuses on providing a good experience for both project creators and people interested in finding and supporting new protocols.

## Miso Benefits:

*   **Easier Token Creation:** Miso makes the process of creating a new token easier.
*   **Larger Audience:** Helps projects attract a larger initial audience.
*   **Peace of Mind:** Provides users (project supporter) with peace of mind that the token was created using tested, audited contracts.

## Sushi's Multi-Chain Strategy

Instead of focusing on predicting which environment will be most dominant, Sushi adopts an open approach, deploying the protocol to all popular blockchains and scaling solutions.

### Current Deployments:

*   Ethereum Mainnet
*   Polygon
*   xDai
*   BSC (Binance Smart Chain)
*   Fantom
*   Moonbeam
*   Upcoming: Arbitrum (Layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution)

## Conclusion

Sushi's ecosystem, profit-sharing mechanism for token holders, increasing number of chains deployed on, scaling solution being used make it a strong DeFi project. Is, however, Sushi underrated ?
