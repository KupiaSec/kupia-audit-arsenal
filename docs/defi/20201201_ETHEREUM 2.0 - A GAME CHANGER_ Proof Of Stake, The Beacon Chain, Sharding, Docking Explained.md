# Ethereum 2.0: A Deep Dive into Proof of Stake, the Beacon Chain, Sharding, and Docking

Ethereum 2.0 (Eth2), also known as Serenity, represents a significant set of interconnected upgrades designed to address the critical issues of scalability, security, and sustainability that the current Ethereum network faces. This article provides a detailed explanation of the key components of Ethereum 2.0 and how they contribute to achieving these goals.

## The Need for Ethereum 2.0

The Ethereum network, while revolutionary, is currently limited to around 15 transactions per second (TPS). This limitation poses a significant challenge for onboarding millions of new users and launching more decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum 2.0 aims to overcome this bottleneck by increasing transaction throughput to thousands of transactions per second, without compromising security or decentralization. Additionally, the current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism is energy-intensive, raising environmental concerns.

## Core Goals of Eth2

*   **Scalability:** Increase the transactions per second to thousands, supporting the onboarding of millions of users with the launching of many dApps.
*   **Security:** Enhance the network to protect against various attacks such as 51% attack, ensuring data integrity.
*   **Sustainability:** Reduce the energy consumption and protect the environment, eventually moving away from PoW.

## Key Components of Ethereum 2.0

### 1. Proof of Stake (PoS)

The transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) is a core aspect of Ethereum 2.0. PoW requires miners to invest significant resources, mainly electricity, to validate transactions and secure the network. This is energy-intensive and raises environmental concerns.

With PoS, miners are replaced by validators. Validators stake their ETH to participate in the consensus process. Instead of depending on computational power, PoS relies on the stakers' economic incentive. By staking ETH, users become validators, receiving block rewards and transaction fees for validating transactions.

To discourage validators from acting dishonestly, a mechanism called "slashing" is implemented. Dishonest validators lose part of their staked ETH, making a 51% attack difficult and expensive. To pull off the attack the attacker must control 51% of the validators, requiring a massive amount of capital. Validators can earn as high as 18% rewards annually. There might be returns for validators as low as 1.81% annually or even lower if there are more than 100 million ETH in the system.

PoS addresses all three goals of Eth2, sustainable because removing energy intensive miners makes it more secure and more scalable.

### 2. Sharding

Sharding is a database partitioning technique that splits the entire database into multiple smaller, more manageable instances called shards. In Ethereum 2.0 and each shard is a separate new chain. Initially, there are 64 such shards.

Sharding supports the scalable architecture on Ethereum. It spreads the network's load, and each Ethereum node is only required to run one of those shards that makes storing only a small subset of data is enough. This results in network participants and nodes are easier to run.

Initially sharded chains won't be able to handle transactions or smart contracts which leads to layer 2 scaling (i.e. roll-ups) to be required to scale transactions.

### 3. The Beacon Chain

The Beacon Chain is responsible for coordinating the proof-of-stake (PoS) system by randomly assigning stakers to validate different shards. Beacon Chain is responsible for validating validators and preventing from colluding and taking over.

This is the first thing on Eth2 roadmap and its launch is one of the first things to do. In order to achieve launch first 16,384 validators has to be reached. The beacon chain addresses Ethereum's scalability and security concerns as it was first imagined in the Eth2 roadmap, and it creates the new proof-of-stake network runs in parallel with current ethereum chain.

### 4. Docking

Docking enables the current Ethereum chain to become one of the shards, but it is the only chart that handles transactions and smart contracts. Docking will also mark the end of proof-of-work model on Ethereum and docking brings the ability to run smart contracts into the PoS stystem.

Docking ensures that the legacy transition to all holders and data of current system allow the same way, offering a smooth transition. Docking with staking implies more security and sustainability.

## Ethereum 2.0 Rollout Phases

1.  **Phase 0 (Beacon Chain Launch):** First phase is the launching of new beacon chain, which is already reached a necessary amount of validators.
2.  **Phase 1 (Data Sharding):** Data sharding or data shards focused on the sharding but to be specific on *data sharding*.
3.  **Phase 1.5 (Docking):** The docking for legacy and full integration of eth2 to move validator from pow to pos.

The specific timeline for future phases remains uncertain and will depend on the success of earlier phases and ongoing research. The good news is that with Phase 1.5 dock and staking - all the requirements from Eth2 are already implemented! Future roadmaps might not even need full sharding and it all " remains to be seen" , whether those improvements will be needed or if data sharding and roll up solutions become enough.

## Conclusion

Ethereum 2.0 is a bold and ambitious endeavor with the potential to transform the Ethereum network into a more scalable, secure, and sustainable platform. The combination data sharding and roll ups will result in over 100 000 transactions pre-second with smart and economic improvement that are made. The journey is ongoing, and the outcome will depend on successful implementation and community adoption. Whether the other smart contract blockchain (aka Ethereum Killers) become irrelevant depends on this.
