# The Truth About DeFi: Current State and Future Prospects

This blog post summarizes the key points and insights from the YouTube video "The TRUTH About DEFI".  It focuses on the current state of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), its scaling challenges, and potential future scenarios, including developments on Ethereum and other chains.

## Current State of DeFi

DeFi experienced a significant boom in 2021. The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi grew from approximately $15 billion to over $45 billion within a few months.  Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) also witnessed substantial growth, achieving all-time highs with monthly trading volumes exceeding $50 billion. Many DeFi tokens have also experienced notable increases in value, attracting further participation in the space. Visa has announced they will start settling transactions in USDC on Ethereum.

## Scaling Solutions on Ethereum

DeFi, primarily built on Ethereum, faces scaling challenges due to high transaction fees.  Layer-2 scaling solutions and sidechains are being explored to address these limitations.

### Layer-2 Scaling

Layer-2 solutions rely on the security of the main Ethereum chain (Layer 1) while processing transactions off-chain. A prominent Layer-2 scaling approach includes Rollups, which improves the throughput. Rollups execute transactions outside of Layer 1, but posts transaction data on Layer 1, allowing rollups secured by the main Ethereum chain.

Rollups are classified into two types:

*   **Optimistic Rollups:** Run an EVM-compatible virtual machine, allowing for executing the same smart contracts as on Ethereum. Optimism and Arbitrum are popular examples.  However, withdrawals can take a long time for settlements to be fully realized.
*   **ZK-Rollups:** Provides faster and more efficient speed compare to optimized rollups. Examples projects using ZK-Rollups include StarkWare, ImmutableX,  and dYdX. ZK-Rollups do not typically provide an easy way for smart contracts to migrate to Layer 2, at least not just yet. zkSync is working on an EVM compatible virtual machine that will be able to fully support any arbitrary smart contracts written in Solidity, planning to be released somewhere in August.

### Sidechains

Sidechains operate independently of the Ethereum main chain and possess their own security models and consensus mechanisms.  Matic (Polygon) POS chain, and xDai chain are examples of sidechains. Sidechains offers great transaction speed and efficient, but comes additional security. Another limitation is Lack of Smart Contract Composability between Scaling Solutions.

## DeFi on Other Chains

Acknowledging the challenges on Ethereum, other blockchain networks are actively vying to attract DeFi projects and users.  Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Solana, Avalanche, and Bitcoin are examples of chains attempting to build their own DeFi ecosystem.

### Binance Smart Chain
Even though Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is considered to be more CD5 than DF5, it succeeded at attracting a lot of users and trading volume in a very short amount. Due to being forked from Ethereum, it allows deploying same smart contracts available on Ethereum. Projects such as 1inch and Alpha Homora, are a of the projects that expanded their reach and launched on BSC in parallel to Ethereum.

### Other Chains.
Besides BSC, a lot of other chains have their own security models and levels of decentralization. There also efforts on Solana, Avalanche and even Bitcoin, all putting effort in building their own Defi ecosystem

## Future of DeFi

The future landscape of DeFi is uncertain, but it is almost guaranteed every potential technological solution will be explored.

### Challenges and Opportunities

*   **Composability and Interoperability:** A fragmented landscape with limited composability between different scaling solutions on Ethereum and interoperability between different blockchains currently imposes friction.

*   **Bridges and Interoperable Ecosystems:**  The development of bridges that allow the seamless transfer of assets and data between different blockchains and networks is seen as a major step towards improving interoperability.

*   **Evolving Landscape:** Ongoing technological evolution means that what we consider the prominent blockchains and scaling solutions today might shift in their market share and significance. Projects and ideas without strong communities will die off, while only the projects that have proven to be long-lasting or have had been built and continue built even through hard time will remain to create and support strong communities.

### Key Takeaway

Individual DeFi projects are susceptible to market risks, and a bear market could weed out weaker projects. Hence it will be important to stay up to speed on things related to both Defi and and Crypto Finance. What ever we do in Defi and crypto is only going to get better, as long as the technology continues to improve. That in combination for us knowing what it is that we should be doing with Defi.
