# How (Not) To Get REKT - DeFi Hacks Explained

## Introduction

The video "How (Not) To Get REKT - DeFi Hacks Explained" delves into the world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and the various risks associated with it, particularly focusing on common hacks and exploits. It highlights the importance of understanding these risks to minimize the chances of losing funds in the DeFi space. The video is a collaboration between Cinematics and Rect.news, aiming to educate viewers on the intricacies of DeFi security.

## Common DeFi Hacks and Exploits

### Rug Pulls

A common type of DeFi hack is the "rug pull," where a project team suddenly removes liquidity from a liquidity pool, causing the token price to plummet. This can be done by malicious teams who create a project, attract users, and then drain the liquidity pool for profit. The video explains that while a rug pull can be executed by an anonymous team, it is not necessarily a bad thing. For instance, the Meerkat Finance hack resulted in a loss of $33.8 million in October 2020. The team behind the project used deepfake technology to create a fake CEO and manipulate user trust.

### Flash Loans

Flash loans are uncollateralized loans that must be repaid within the same transaction. They are often used for arbitrage, where price differences between markets are exploited for profit. However, they can also be used for malicious purposes, such as price manipulation. The video provides an example of Harvest Finance, where attackers used flash loans to manipulate prices and withdraw funds, resulting in a loss of $33.8 million.

### Arbitrage

Arbitrage involves taking advantage of price differences between markets. In DeFi, this can be done using flash loans. However, if a protocol has vulnerabilities, arbitrage can lead to significant losses. The video mentions an incident with Saddle Finance, where arbitragers exploited a code limitation, resulting in a loss of funds for early liquidity providers.

### Exploits and Hacks

The video discusses the distinction between hacks and exploits. While both involve taking advantage of vulnerabilities in code, the term "exploit" might be more appropriate for certain types of attacks. Regardless of the terminology, the end result is the same: funds are lost. The video emphasizes that even security audits do not guarantee safety, as evidenced by the leaderboard on Rect.news, which shows that many audited protocols have been hacked.

## Security Audits

Security audits are not a foolproof guarantee of safety. The video highlights that even well-known audit firms like Certik and PeckShield have failed audits. Users often mistakenly believe that a security audit covers an entire protocol forever. However, protocols are dynamic, and even a thorough audit can become useless with a single small update.

## Conclusion

The video concludes by asking viewers for their thoughts on DeFi hacks and whether they have been affected by any of them. It encourages viewers to comment below and check out Direct.news for more content. The video also promotes the creators' Patreon page and thanks viewers for watching.

## Key Takeaways

- **Rug Pulls**: Be cautious of projects with anonymous teams and ensure liquidity is locked for a significant period.
- **Flash Loans**: Understand the risks associated with flash loans and how they can be used for price manipulation.
- **Arbitrage**: Be aware of the potential for arbitrage to lead to losses if a protocol has vulnerabilities.
- **Security Audits**: Recognize that security audits are not a guarantee of safety and that protocols can still be hacked.

By understanding these risks and taking appropriate precautions, users can minimize their chances of getting "REKT" in the DeFi space.
