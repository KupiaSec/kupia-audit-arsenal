# Unlocking DeFi Potential: A Deep Dive into NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)

This article summarizes the key concepts of NFTs and their potential applications within the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape, extracted from a YouTube video.

## What are NFTs?

NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token.  They are cryptographic tokens representing ownership of unique digital assets. They contrast with fungible tokens like ETH or USDT, where each unit is interchangeable and indistinguishable.

## Understanding Fungibility

Fungibility, in economics, is the characteristic of a good or commodity where each individual unit is interchangeable and indistinguishable.

*   **Fungible Example (US Dollar):** A five-dollar bill can be exchanged for another five-dollar bill without affecting its value or the holder's position.

*   **Non-Fungible Example (Limited Edition Basketball Card):** Each card is treated as unique with individual properties. A card of one player doesn't have the same value as a card of another player. Even identical cards can have different values depending on their condition and production year.

## Key Properties of NFTs

1.  **Unique:** Each NFT possesses distinct properties usually stored within the token's metadata, making it non-interchangeable.
2.  **Provably Scarce:**  The number of NFTs is typically limited and verifiable on the blockchain. Though in an extreme example sometimes there is only one. The number of tokens are recorded on the blockchain.
3.  **Indivisible:** NFTs usually cannot be split into smaller denominations. You can't buy a fraction of an NFT.
4.  **Ownership Guarantee:** NFTs provide guaranteed and easily transferable ownership of the underlying asset. Proven to be fraud proof too.
5.  **ERC-721 and ERC-1155 Standards:** These are common Ethereum standards for creating NFTs.
    *   **ERC-721:** A popular standard used to create distinguishable tokens, allowing creation of various unique tokens. A good example here is CryptoKitties.
    *   **ERC-1155:** It supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens within the same contract.  Developed by Enjin, this standard's design is particularly suitable for blockchain gaming. In many games the player can hold non-fungible items, such as swords and shields, and fungible items like gold and arrows. 

## NFTs and DeFi: A Synergistic Relationship

NFTs hold significant potential to revolutionize decentralized finance.

### 1. NFTs as Collateral for Loans

One of the most interesting ideas is using NFTs as collateral for DeFi loans.  Instead of standard collateral, users could supply NFTs representing art, digital land, or tokenized real estate to borrow funds.

#### The Challenge: Price Discovery & Illiquidity

Measuring the value of NFTs is difficult because the NFT markets very often don't have liquidity. The market can even be non-existent. Standard price oracles can be hard to build because they draw on liquid sources.

#### A Potential Solution: P2P NFT Loans Marketplace

A more tailored approach involves peer-to-peer lending marketplaces.  Borrowers can offer NFTs as collateral, and lenders choose which NFTs they are willing to accept based on their perceived value. The NFT is kept in an escrow contract to make sure the contract will fulfill the borrower's side.

The value can also be volatile.

### 2. Representing Complex Financial Products

NFTs can also represent financial products such as insurance contracts, bonds or options.

#### yInsure as an Example

yInsure is an insurance space where each insurance contract is represented as an NFT which can be traded on the secondary market.

### 3. DeFi-Native Concepts and NFTs

NFTs can also be used along side innovative DeFi protocols and features.

* **Liquidity Mining:** NFD projects (like Variable) reward their users (that create buying and selling action on the marketplace) with governance tokens.

## Final Thoughts

The NFT space is seeing huge potential and recent examples are ranging from digital kittens to complex financial products.

It's a rapidly growing niche in the crypto world, and its application in DeFi has the potential to unlock unprecedented opportunities and financial innovation.
