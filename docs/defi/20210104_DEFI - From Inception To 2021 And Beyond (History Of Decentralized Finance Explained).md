# DEFI - From Inception To 2021 And Beyond (History Of Decentralized Finance Explained)

This article summarizes the key milestones and developments in the history of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), from its foundational roots to its explosive growth in 2020 and beyond, as presented in the referenced YouTube video.

## The Genesis of DeFi: Bitcoin and Ethereum

While there's no universally agreed-upon birthdate for DeFi, the video highlights two critical, foundational events:

1.  **Bitcoin's Creation (2009):** Satoshi Nakamoto's creation of Bitcoin was the *key enabler*.  Although whether Bitcoin itself is classified as DeFi is debatable, it introduced the core concept of a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency and, importantly, *enabled the creation of Ethereum*. Bitcoin allowed for decentralized payments, which is one area of finance.

2.  **Ethereum's Launch (2015):**  Vitalik Buterin launched Ethereum, which became the *de facto blockchain for top DeFi protocols.* Bitcoin's scripting language ("Script") was too limited for complex financial applications.  Ethereum, with its Turing-complete programming language, Solidity, and the ERC-20 token standard, provided the necessary tools for developers to build a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps), including those focused on finance.

## Early DeFi Pioneers and Concepts

The video points to several projects that laid the groundwork for the DeFi ecosystem:

*   **MakerDAO (Formed in 2014, Launched late 2017):**  One of the *oldest DeFi projects on Ethereum,* MakerDAO is a protocol that allows for the creation of the decentralized stablecoin DAI. The first iteration supported only ETH as collateral, which later expanded to multi-collateral DAI. Maker remains one of the most *important and early pioneers* of the DeFi space.

*   **EtherDelta (Popular in 2017):**  One of the *first decentralized exchanges (DEXs)* built on Ethereum, EtherDelta allowed for *permissionless exchange of ERC-20 tokens*. It used an *order book model*, which, on Layer 1, is hard and usually results in poor user experience.  The exchange was hacked in 2017, and its founder was later charged by the SEC for running an unregistered securities exchange.

*   **The ICO Era (2017):** Although not exclusively DeFi, the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) boom of 2017 saw many projects that *would today be classified as DeFi*.  ICOs, while conceptually about decentralized fundraising, unfortunately, resulted in many overhyped projects without substance.  However, some important DeFi protocols emerged from this era, including:
    *   **Aave:** Lending and borrowing.
    *   **Synthetix (previously Havven):** A liquidity protocol for derivatives.
    *   **Ren (previously Republic Protocol):** A protocol for providing access to inter-blockchain liquidity.
    *   **Kyber Network:** An on-chain liquidity protocol.
    *   **0x:** An open protocol for peer-to-peer exchange of assets.
    *    **Bancor**: On-chain liquidity protocol.

## The "Before COMP" Era (2018-Early 2020): Building the Foundation

The video describes this period as a seemingly "quiet" time after the ICO craze, but, in reality, it was a crucial period of development. Major Key happenings:

* **User-to-Contract Model.** One of the main breakthroughs at that time, was the interaction with smart contact containing pooled funds from multiple users, rather than interacting with other users.
*   **Uniswap v1 Launch (November 2, 2018):**  Hayden Adams published the initial version of Uniswap to the Ethereum mainnet.  Uniswap is considered *one of the most important projects in the DeFi space*.  Crucially, it was built on the concept of *liquidity pools and automated market makers (AMMs)*, leveraging the user-to-contract model.  The first version was entirely funded by a grant from the Ethereum Foundation.
*   **Synthetix Liquidity Incentives (2019):** Synthetix launched the *first liquidity incentive program* for its Uniswap ETH-USD pair. This incentivized liquidity providersâ€”another breakthrough for the future DeFi Summer.

*   **Other Launches (2018-2019):** Several other DeFi protocols, including Compound, Ren, Kyber, and 0x, launched their protocols on the Ethereum mainnet.

* **Black Thursday." (March 12, 2020)**, there was a massive stress test for the DeFi industry. The price of ETH dropped by more than 30%. That caused multiple users trying to increase their collateral.

## The DeFi Summer of 2020: Explosive Growth

The "DeFi Summer" of 2020 marked a period of rapid growth and innovation, largely triggered by:

*   **Compound's Liquidity Mining (May 2020):**  Compound launched its COMP token liquidity mining program, rewarding users for lending and borrowing on the Compound platform. This *extra incentive* resulted in a dramatic increase in supply and borrow APYs, and is what also *enabled development of Yield Farming.*
*   **Governance tokens:** Created Compound governance, where users with COMP tokens could vote on different proposed changes to the protocol. Compound's governance model was later reused to govern DeFi projects.
*   **Yearn Finance (Early 2020):**  Developed by Andre Cronje, Yearn Finance is a *yield optimizer* that automatically switches between different lending protocols to maximize DeFi capabilities. Yearn further decentralized by distributing its governance token, YFI, to the community via *liquidity mining*, with no VC or founder/dev rewards. This attracted a lot of support from the DeFi community in July 2020.
*   **Ampleforth:** Gained moree traction thanks to it's unique elastic supply.
*   **Yam Finance (August 11, 2020):**  Yam Finance was designed to build interest in strong Defi Communities by rewardind holders. One day after launch, had 0.5 Billion dollars in total value locked.
    A critical bug was found in the rebase mechanism.
*   **SushiSwap (End of August 2020):**  Launched by an anonymous team, SushiSwap introduced the concept of a *"vampire attack,"* aiming to siphon liquidity from Uniswap by incentivizing Uniswap's liquidity providers with SUSHI tokens. It attracted $1 billion worth of liquidity, aided by drama where developer Chef Nomi selling token stakes; eventually, the protocol migrated a lot of Uniswap's liquidity.
*   **The Rise of "Food DeFi":**  Following Yam and Sushi, many other projects (Pasta, Spaghetti, Kimchi, Hot Dog, etc.) launched, most of which quickly failed.
*   **Uniswap's UNI Token Launch and Airdrop (September 2020):**  As a response to SushiSwap and to further decentralize, Uniswap launched its own UNI token, rewarding previous users and liquidity providers with a *retrospective airdrop*, which led to a significant resurgence in Uniswap's activity.

## DeFi Winter and rebound

Following the initial exuberance, the market sentiment shifted in September and October 2020. Major DeFi tokens started sharply declining, and the yields from liquidity mining decreased. Despite a temporary downturn ("DeFi Winter"), developers continued building, and the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi continued to trend upwards. By early November, the DeFi market began to recover.

## Key Takeaways and the Future of DeFi

*   **From Foundational Building Blocks to Explosive Growth:** The history of DeFi shows a clear progression from foundational technologies (Bitcoin, Ethereum) to early experiments (MakerDAO, EtherDelta) to the liquidity-mining-fueled boom of 2020.
*   **Innovation and Iteration:**  DeFi is characterized by rapid innovation and iteration.  Projects build upon each other's successes (and failures), leading to new models like AMMs, liquidity mining, and yield optimization.
*   **Composability as a Key Driver:** The ability to combine different DeFi protocols like Lego bricks ("money legos") is a major factor in DeFi's growth.
* **The Future is Bright**. DeFi developers keep building new, innovative projects. Much-needed scaling is also coming in form of Ethereum 2.0, Layer 2 solutions, and even other blockchains. This will allow for new set of users to start participating in DeFi. It will also help with discovering new use cases, that were previously impossible due to high network fees.
*   **Challenges Remain:**  Hacks and security vulnerabilities remain a significant risk in the DeFi space, as evidenced by multiple incidents throughout 2020.

The video concludes by emphasizing the ongoing development and bright future for DeFi, highlighting future possibilities, like bringing traditional assets to DeFi, Layer 2 scaling solutions, and interoperability protocols.
