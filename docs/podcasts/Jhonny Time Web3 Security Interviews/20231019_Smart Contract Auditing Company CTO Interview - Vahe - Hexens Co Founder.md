Q: *Before we dive deep into Hexens and sharing tips for web3 security for researchers that are just getting started. Let's hear a bit about your background. What kind of technical/cybersecurity background do you have?*
A:  *I started with web2 cybersecurity, been in cybersecurity for over a decade. First, I was doing penetration testing, code reviews, and red teaming. Then I transitioned to blockchain Security.*

Q: *How did you shift from traditional red teaming, penetration testing to blockchain security?*
A: *It's an interesting story. I was loving web2 security, but I was always following what was going on with blockchain and crypto. There was a big DAOHaus hack. People in security were talking about blockchain more in security. It struck me that there are a lot of impact people not understanding how it works what smart contracts are. So, I decided to take my time and started learning it from scratch.*

Q: *You shifted into blockchain Security. Do you remember what kind of resources you used to learn blockchain and blockchain security?*
A: *Back then in 2019, there weren’t that many resources. The information was really very scattered throughout the internet.* *The only thing really started to explain what kind of higher level and at least on kind is like high-level what kind of attacks to give like EUT war game from O yeah that was the only resource, structured and best place if you know, 0 knowledge about blockchains on the smart contract security.*

**Early Days of Hexens**

Q: *How from learning blockchain security you shifted towards starting your own auditing firm company, hexen? Tell us a bit of the story about how Hexens started?*
A: *Here's the thing:  when i first started the cyber security I was doing a lot of CTFs. That is very good way to learn um cyber security as well so and there was at some point uh me and my partner decided try uh starting our own like uh Service Company uh to provide like Pent test and all the classic Cyber Security stuff. At the point when we decided to transit like to blockchain and start doing blockchain security, we already had this, let’s say we were running a small, it was a quite a small company uh doing web2 uh but yeah so it was not a question that before transiting I was not trying to be entrepreneur or whatever. We already were running it. The only decisions come to transit the focus like we're not focusing on web2. We focusing on web3 from now. So started from scratch, because nobody liked no no one of us really knew like decently let's say how everything works how you know how to audit smart contracts, how audit blockchains and whatever.

A lot of people wanted to go to some robber stamp know certificates and mainly that kind of companies had some lines and will you know, we started charging the market average or whatever it was at the time so. When I first started in the cyber security I was uh doing a lot of ctfs then that's a very good way to, and that's actually very good way to it's not the only way. But it is very decent way to learn.
