Okay, here's the summary of the YouTube video, based on the transcript, in a conversational format:

**Intro (0:00 - 0:29)**

I began the video by introducing my guest, Nitsan, as one of my best friends and the person who introduced me to Ethereum, Illuvium, and other opportunities in the crypto space. I call him a genius and one of the smartest investors I've ever met.

**Getting to know Nitsan (0:29 - 2:10)**

Q: Nitsan, could you tell us more about your experience and background?
A: Sure. I've been developing websites for over 10 years. I had several apps and websites in the internet space. I had a business of content arbitrage, buying a lot of traffic from social networks. Now, I'm focused on investing in crypto and stocks, plus a little travel.

Q: So you're basically 'retired', investing, and travelling. That's what you're doing these days?
A: Yes investing and traveling, but sometimes, you know I work on the side for little arbitrage in internet businesses for content websites. Still very updated in the crypto industry and always looking for new opportunities, new projects and buying new things.

**Getting into Crypto (2:10 - 8:01)**

Q: Nitsan, who introduced you to crypto, and what was the experience like? What made you look into blockchains?

A: Well, 2013, after the Army, I started looking for new opportunities and getting into the tech industry
