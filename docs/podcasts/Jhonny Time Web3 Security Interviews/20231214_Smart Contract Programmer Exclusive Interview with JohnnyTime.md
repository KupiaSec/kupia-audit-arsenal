Okay, here is a summary of the "Smart Contract Programmer Exclusive Interview with JohnnyTime" from my perspective.

**Introduction (0:00 - 0:45)**

Q: Introduction of Taz, also known as Smart Contract Programmer

A: Hi guys, I'm a smart contract programmer creating YouTube videos about smart contract programming, mostly using Solidity and Viper. I also dabble in DeFi stuff.

**Journey Introduction (0:45 - 1:15)**

Q: Can you tell us a bit about yourself? About your background and what you do?

A: Sure. So, I'm known as Smart Contract Programmer, where I create YouTube videos, mostly about solidity but I also create videos about similar stuff.

**Background Story (1:15 - 3:30)**

Q: Give us a short background about how you got into programming, in general and how your journey looks like.

A:
*   Went to university studying math.
*   First programming course learned was C.
*   Enjoyed it, but didn't think it was for me, as I didn't like staring at a computer all day.
*   After university, did some traveling. Came back to Japan and worked as a construction worker.
*   Didn't know what I wanted to do, worked in a mountain cabin.
*   Picked up PHP programming, and it turned into first PHP job that I enjoyed.

**Becoming a Solidity Expert (3:30 - 5:17)**

Q: What do you feel that made you change from a hardcore C, to PHP and now become such an expert in Solidity.

A:
*   As PHP developer for about 10 years. Went to Australia, then Japan.
*   Picked up blockchain programming. Started with Bitcoin and then got into Lightning Network.
*   Then I started looking for a job in blockchain programming. Had Solidity job interview and started with that.
*   That's where got first experience with solidity. Then have been learning more and more of Ethereum.

**YouTube Channel (5:17 - 8:00)**

Q: So, about 5 years ago you got yourself a blockchain programming job in Japan. From the construction work in Japan to PHP. How long was the transition before you started YouTube channel?

A: The job lasted less than a year. Then started freelancing and my Youtube channel for Smart Contract Programmer.

**Solidity Teaching Approach and Coursework (8:00 - 10:07)**

Q: I mean you had a bit bad experience with C, but you had a really good experience by learning PHP and going to learn Solidity programming?

A: Uh, it was definitely uh, difficult for me to really for something to click. Yeah, uh bought his book and got more uh interested in Bitcoin after

**Use of Bitcoin (10:07 - 11:19)**

Q: So you got into Bitcoins, exploring the lightning network and did you also invest into Bitcoin?

A: First got really interested in video talk on YouTube about Andreas Antonopoulos with his book, making me interested in bitcoin and at that time I think I was 28 or 29 or in a working holiday in Australia, so i bought bitcoin with bank transfer to Australia as fund to then get it easy and so I bought the bitcoin to keep in case that something goes wrong to have some cash back.

**Joining The Ecosystem (11:19 - 14:22)**

Q: That is very interesting because it's one of the use case I was super happy to see that TAZ is the guy behind his channel, because he is so knowledgeable but at the same time how humble, so let's dive into the channel, the story behind the channel after that. When came around time to code it and find yourself learning more an more you decided on solidity what made you do that?

A: So I applied to that so that’s when I first uh, picked up solidity. Uh I didn’t get the job, but that’s where I first uh got uh learning experience and solidity and ever since, then, uh, I’ve been learning Ethereum uh solidity programming

**Creating Youtube Content (14:22 - 14:58)**

Q: Okay so about five years ago I think you got a block chain programming job in Japan and then that where it all started you you got to block chain programming how many times pass you decided to create your channel ?

A: I do Blockchain programming job in Japan, it only lasted less than one year and then that's when I started freelancing um started my YouTube channel for smart contract programmer to share my experience on block chain programming job in Japan.

**Best Learning Experience Advice (14:58 - 17:04)**

Q: We know what it took hours to make videos but it looks that it’s kind of mind blowing that someone are now starting with solidity and you will see it if I do this interview we all think so

A;It's was difficult as it was in change set from mind but once you get it clicking more easier but also I remember for then to improve.

**Content Creation, Editing and Delivery (17:04 - 26:07)**

Q: You said that you talk at You Tube you had a bit bit and it is hardcore but probably is beginner begin C and then

A: Yeah Uh So yeah uh bought his book read His book and and that time i said around to working holiday in Austrailia got programmer

**Advice on How To Get Started (26:07 to 41:26)**

Q: Can you mention all these kind of stuff?

A: That's okay! So after that to Australia in Japan and after that network I found job in At that time so I tried and said that it would happen and then after to Australia

 **Next Stage. (41:26 to 42:40)**
Okay So now it is going to dive into YouTube channel about

**How Smart Contract Programming Is a Worthwhile Career (42.40 to End)**

Q: I just I want to be a dev you can turn and if I find it it for

A: I first to YouTube. I was talking by Andre and started to look like

In Summary, as a teacher, when I'm having a student or a friend is telling me he wants to be a solidity I have to tell them You that I’m able to be to him and that means is that I tell him “It will be a great journey! So enjoy it!”
