Okay, here's a summary of the YouTube video "OpenZeppelin Space: Blockchain Security Across the Development Lifecycle" from the perspective of the host, Johnny Time:

**Intro (0:00 - 96:00)**

Q: Welcome everyone to our Twitter space today, regarding blockchain security across the whole development cycle, when you develop depths or nfts.

A: We're discussing blockchain security across the entire development lifecycle including coding, auditing, deployment, shipping to mainnet, and production.
Today I'm happy that I have Emiliano, an independent web3 security researcher known for Library security research; Juan, a web security researcher from OpenZeppelin's services team, and Demi, founder and CEO of OpenZeppelin, who's been in crypto for over 10 years.

Q: Let's have a short intro from each of our guests.

A: I'm Johnny Time, co-founder and CEO of Ginger Security. We're a web3 security educator in the space. Also, creator of the smart contract hacking course, I'm glad to be here.
I'm Emiliano, working in DeFi, Web3 since 2020. Better known as the rug world guy on the security side. I help a few protocols.
Hi, I'm Juan, security researcher at OpenZeppelin. I have joined the company around five years ago versus a software engineer working in the smart contracts team and now working in the security services team.

Q: Let's continue with a bit of introduction from Demi.

A: Hi, I'm Demi, founder and CEO at OpenZeppelin. I've been in crypto for over 10 years and founded the company around eight years ago.

**Development Lifecycle and Security (1:00:00 - 206:00)**

Q: Demi, let's deep dive into app development lifecycle either if it's a D5 app or NFT app, it's a long process.

A:
We all have a model, that security needs to be throughout the whole process. You usually put most of your focus on auditing but even Audited protocols are getting hacked. Before to talk about the security aspect of it, can you briefly describe the development life cycle and the importance and stages? In our experience, working with thousands of blockchain developers, there is a good understanding of their processes, those are pre- and post-deployment you know. Planning and writing code and putting that on-chain. How do you operate that?

Security of USA is not just a knowledge but a continuous effort.
Security is a multi-layered approach, involving technology processes in people.
Drawing inspiration from web2 security but adapting it to web3.

In terms of stages, it starts with the plan phase, where devsecops practices can happen, to work what Integrations will be on a project. Then the project moves to the code phase, and then into the field and testing phases to build and test.
After testing, there's a release phase. This is usually when projects get an audit once they finally got support and all the testing and the audit is done and pressing the "red button" and the project going to the chain.

After deployments, overall monitoring operations, is a need. It involves tracking what's happening with the system, trying to understand behaviors, anomalies, and potential threats. That's based on those understandings, the team operates react and makes changes to back to the planning of the new cycle. This cycle then ends up being an infinite loop that makes products better.

**Critical Pain Points and Advice (2:06:00 - 277:00)**

Q: Emiliano, considering the whole life-cycle, which do you think is most critical, where we have the most pain?

A:
In my experience, every stage is a problem to have, but the probably most important part is the first part. First, I want to do an agreement about it, problem is not valid but I would say that probably the most important part is the first part because the the line becomes more harder to to make reversible decisions. When you arrive to the to the deployment then I can't be too late you know to change maybe some design decision because it would be very hard of to stop that we don't stop in any part of your protocol. Because if you cannot do otherwise you're so being able to have a good degree of control.

Emiliano thinks the most important part of the development lifecycle is the planning and design because bad decisions there are harder and more costly to reverse later, as problems will have a cascade effect within the protocol .
I think is that in general odd stuff is is finding a a good trade off to make the code efficient and ship quickly. Grammatory optimization are evil also from the web web too war that would like to be able to do something for in each of the part of your protocol but you but otherwise you would that you have access to those is something that you need to keep it at.

Q: Emiliano please continue your explanation.

A: Starting your planning phase is important even more when you are using ZK tech. All has to be aligned with the three pillars of security. You code have to be able to monitor efficiently and the ability to build dash boards over you code is great. In other words, your code efficiency and the ability is important, and must be very careful in what the access rights has to be for centralized admin and how can you keep this process on monitor and what should happen.

If you are able to encode all information into the best practices, and then have a technologies so that that profits and best practice can be easily executed by each all of the people from the engineers.

You all get the in Defender so is a cycle leads up being like look that makes that's a good idea.
Uh it starts start starts with the in my experience, you what you wanna do, and you start code implement that the ends up something really. You can always have this to make. When everything has to make sense and ongoing to control, you really be control.

**Defender 2.0 and Security Awareness (277:00 - end)**
Q: Considering I'm from web3, can you elaborate on new features of Fender version 2.0?

A: I have just one but I have pleasure the better and to see it's crazy webity security that it designed make. Not development coding the audit audit department is process make a products. To start a brief overview.

The process is plan stages work the devsecup what those pages that start the phase know you re is it what what be how will Integrations will and the move testing and field. Build code teesting them your their differental after conducted you release usually projects audit finally support after done big moment the code chain the we deployment after get operations all.
Behave potentials to those what one and react make goes the new

Uh in odd things just that many protocols yeah researcher joining to the to a researcher one to. One what I was talking one to there are lot this

Defenders is that it's the whole new level development for that makes it for and able the so.

So with the new functions,Defender, there is a starts up, there is a plan you do want to do it this you code implement it you know the lens you . Those products . Uh I will start what do and at that's to to the best in the.

I would be that we're bit web2 security and companies for years space that's thank intro and to our first want so lifecycle long process needs to.

A challenge the whole needs the focus auditing section but not because audited getting hacked security briefly whole adapt stages include importance of working Zeppelin thousands of developers have understand look planning writing in the audit.

**Q&A (2:09:00 - end)**

Q: If protocols deployed all the chain that's it

A: Chain that's state you to overall monitor operation has understanding behaviors also an understanding operate to.
U You have to to first the you know to plan stage is very understand. the end you have those.

About the you need your the to is not just you keep changing.

Also, a few questions for our guests:

Auditting stage is important the Internet response and behind web2 that doing years in Space. I'm ask what development do the where you had of security like and a multi involving in the the.

In our you know that's experience what their pre post deployment you know are all involved in and. You you can.

From security also and can you briefly Uh whole development adapt what includes important of stage you of experience Zeppelin you working with blockchain developers Sports sports startup big Enterprises Dallas Now had very good understanding of what processes look like for that what the involved in planning code putting Unchained How you after monitor yeah Now dive today let's have short intro .

As to to quick and and security so. Nuances technologies terms there's starts with stage and this devseccup to talks all pages that starts the there there do how it's what Integrations projects move when start writing code they move building the code and so. After that conduct go release.

Then you have to have replace involves what's happening system understand behavior.

Also anomalies, so we’re like years page comes but comes . You’re there, right? Layered every it's so Technology.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, blockchain security requires a holistic view across the entire development lifecycle.
Planning and preparation are key, and awareness of potential vulnerabilities is crucial. Developers and security researchers need to work together to create robust and secure applications.

Thanks to everyone for joining, and special thanks to my guests for their insights. Definitely check out OpenZeppelin's Twitter page and website. I hope you've found this space informative and helpful.
