Okay, here is a comprehensive summary of the YouTube video titled "Starkswap Team Interview & Ginger Security Cairo Smart Contract Auditing Review".

**Intro:**

*Q:* General intro to the video.

*A:* Hello everyone, I’m Johnny Time, and in this video I have the pleasure of speaking with the team behind Starkswap which the speaker calls the biggest AMM and decentralised exchange on StarkNet. We will also touch upon the audit that Ginger Security did for Starkswap's Cairo smart contracts, which are built atop StarkNet. StarkNet is a leading Layer 2 ZK-rollup solution sitting on top of Ethereum.

**Part 1: Interview with Starkswap Team**

*Q:* Can you tell us about how you guys got into crypto and how you started with StarkNet leading to building Starkswap?

*A:* *Median* explained that he and *Brand Builder* were working together in their day jobs. They both had been in crypto since 2017 and had a passion for the space. They were exposed to StarkNet and thought their project was cool. The idea was to have a cheaper and faster transaction throughput, which was exciting to them.

*Q:* How did you come up with the idea for Starkswap?

*A:* *Median* continues to explain about scoping out the StarkNet ecosystem early on and recognized a core primitive such as an Automated Market Maker (AMM) was missing . Brand Builder says the focus was always on what kind experience they could build in Defi because there needs to be a solution for trustless and decentralized security.

*Q:* Could you tell us more about features besides the AMM?

*A:* Further into the conversation, they talk about Iron Fleet, a D5 pooling protocol, they'd later added helps users you know with interoperability between one layer and layer one, L2. It helps also to share the gas fees in the long run.

*Q:* What made you chose to built using StarkNet compared to other L2 solutions?

*A:* Again I believe the decision to choose StarkNet was the built in focus on native and decentralized security. Also, the speaker mentions that they know those that are at StarkWare and the developers. They’re able to have an advantage that way.

*Q:* When can investors expect Starkswap on mainnet?

*A:* Mainnet launch is targeted for March 1st but they will shift to later if everything is not in place before that time while a new version of Cairo is on the horizon.

**Part 2: Interview with Gershon from Ginger Security**

*Q:* Gershon, introduce yourself to the audience.

*A:* Gershon began by saying that Ginger Security performed the audit for Starkswap.

*Q:* What is your methodology when coming into smart contract auditing, expecially one written in Cairo.

*A:* Gershon begins to answer about ZK rollups are more secure than Optimistic rollups, but that has been thoroughly tested at the beginning by reading and analyzing all code. I go over the code multiple times to fully undnerstand what the contract is fully doing and what it was implemented.

*Q:* Do you plan further iterations now that the core protocol has been deployed? 

*A:* Yes, the Ginger Security team plan to implement new features to make sure that contracts have upgradedability to help security measures on these smart contracts written in cairo.
