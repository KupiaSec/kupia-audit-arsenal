Okay, here's a comprehensive summary of the "Sherlock Founder Jack Sanford 2 Hours InterviewüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" YouTube video in a Q&A format, from the speaker's perspective:

**Introduction (0:00 - 0:47):**

Q: Hello guys, welcome to another amazing web3 security interview! Today we have with us a special guest, Jack Sanford, the founder behind Sherlock. Sherlock is a platform that everyone should know these days in the web3 security space. We're going to discuss so many interesting topics, share tips for beginner Watsons that want to compete in auditing contests in Sherlock. We're going to see how Sherlock leverage competitive audits with lead Watsons to achieve maximum security for protocols. We're going to talk about Jack's background and what he thinks about the future of the web3 security industry, and also share some road maps and new features that are coming up to Sherlock, so it's going to be super interesting.  We might leak some Alpha. So, without further ado, let's get started!

**Part 1: Jack's Background and Journey (0:53 - 4:22):**

Q: Jack, before we talk about Sherlock, I'm more interested in your background.  How did you get into blockchain security and blockchain in general? We had a previous conversation before, you come from a finance background, and I think it will be very interesting for the listeners to hear your whole story.

A: Definitely. So, my journey is a pretty winding one. I started out actually trying to be a professional tennis player, and a lot of my friends that I grew up playing with are still playing in Wimbledon, in the US Open. I had some injuries, unfortunately, that kept me out of it.  But I still ended up playing at a very high level in college, in the US. But I also focused a lot on school and grades and other things that ended up being pretty important.  Which was good.

So, that was kind of my entry into more of a finance interest. I had always had a really deep interest in finance, and so I went after business school in university. I did Investment Banking afterwards, which is a very intense career, especially at the lower levels. And then I worked at Citadel, basically a big hedge fund, trading bank stocks, essentially investing in bank stocks, going long, short. It gave me a super deep understanding of the traditional financial system.

Seeing it all, the things that are wrong with it, the things that are not ever going to change without massive deregulation. So, I got tired of looking at the same regional bank stocks. I mean it was literally like traveling to Texas, traveling to these different parts of the US. Meeting with random bank CEOs the public companies that were very large, but no one had ever really heard of. I got tired of that and got more of an interest in programming.

That was something that was becoming a lot more important, even at the hedge fund. And so I ended up deciding to leave the hedge fund, get into the startup world. I spent about a year and a half to two years self-teaching programming, building iPhone Apps, building web apps, doing python projects. 

Then I got into Solidity, but there wasn't a whole lot of material out there. This was early 2020. So I read, uh, Mastering Ethereum. Crypto Zombies was around then, and I got into Ether Note. The whole reason was just because I had this background in finance and I saw it or at least, DeFi, which was kind of taking off in 2020, as an actual viable way to improve a financial system.

We hadn't seen, at least *I* hadn‚Äôt seen, for, like, two years, a viable way to improve it while I was working that job at Citadel. So, I got super super interested in it. And I was like, man, this is unbelievable! If we could get one country to use this financial system, like, that would be the craziest thing ever! So how can we make that happen?

Then I just started building. I started doing hackathons in the space.  That's pretty much the entry point and Sherlock was kind of, you know, the natural course of just asking questions, and saying 'how can we make this a real financial system that actually works?', what are the problems? Okay, scalability is a problem. Transaction fees is being too high, that's a problem. But there are some good teams working on that. There are some good efforts. The UX side with the wallets was a problem. But I didn't think I was probably the right person to be building consumer-facing wallets and there were some other good teams out there doing that. So, eventually, I kind of landed on. Okay, well we need to make sure these smart contracts are safe at the end of the day. People are going to put their life savings into these smart contracts! How can we make sure that you can be comfortable doing that?  Um, and so smart contract coverage, Nexus Mutual, Sherlock are the bigger names in that industry.  I guess even though, it‚Äôs still pretty small today, um, that's really important.

**Part 2: The Origin and Intricacies of Sherlock (35:50 - 49:30):**

Q: That's a really interesting journey and, like, transformation from Tennis to to Finance, to tech, to blockchain. So, your first experience with crypto was technical experience or you started as, like, investing or figuring or what is Bitcoin, what is ethereum, and, like, ICOs era. When did you get started like getting into crypto? And, uh, then, when did you realize you want to get into Defi?

A: Yeah, again, early 2020, I think, my first, I think I actually read the Ethereum whitepaper before the Bitcoin whitepaper. And then read, you know, mastering Ethereum, and I happened to, you know, I have a really strong interest in programming at that time, and I still do today, um, but it was just very natural for me to want to understand like, okay, what are these cryptographic guarantees? How do these different things work? I mean, the Ethereum whitepaper, on its own, can get into some pretty uh, technical topics and so I was just like, 'let me try to understand these, and see, basically, I wanted to know if it was legitimate or not, like, are people, this is this kind of a scammy thing, or not?'.  Because I was around in 2017, I was paying attention, um, and so I just wanted to figure out like, okay, crypto. is crypto kind of dead? Like early 2020, not a lot of exciting stuff was happening, still, yet at least, it hadn't really picked up.
And so, I was looking at it like man, this space is totally dead, but if what they're talking about is real, like if these things technically, like, check out, then this is one of the most exciting things that's going to happen.‚Äù

So, how can we make that happen? And I just started building. I started doing hackathons in the space. Um, and - yeah, that's pretty much the entry point, and Sherlock was kind of you know, the natural course of just asking questions, and saying 'how can we make this a real financial system that actually works?', What are the problems? Okay, scalability is a problem. Transaction fees is being too high, that's a problem. But there are some good teams working on that. There are some good efforts.

Q: What is Sherlock about, and how did it start?

A: Sure.  Continuing where we kind of left off, 2020, I was just trying to learn a lot.  I was learning Solidity, I was trying to learn about different ecosystems. 

And I think I spent like three or four months, maybe two to three years, self-teaching programming, building iPhone apps, you know, building web apps, um, doing Python projects, um, and so you know, I wish I had senior courses back then because I eventually got into Solidity, there wasn't a whole lot. There wasn't, a whole lot of material out there, but I remember reading Mastering Ethereum. , I did Crypto Zombies was around then, is got into Ethernot, um and yeah I mean the whole reason was just because I had this background in finance, and I saw ethereum or at least, Defi which was kind of taking off in 2020, as an actual viable way to improve, a financial system‚Ä¶ 

We hadn't seen, at least I hadn't seen for like two years, a viable way to improve it while I was working that job at Citadel.  So I got super super interested in it and I was like, man, this is unbelievable! If we could get one country to use this financial system, like that would be the craziest thing ever! So how can we make that happen? How can we do it?  And I just started building. started doing hackathons in the space, um. That's pretty much the entry point and Sherlock was kind of the natural course of just asking questions, and saying how can we make this a real financial system that actually works?

What are the problems? Okay, scalability is a problem. Transaction fees was being too high. That's a problem. But there are some some good teams working on that there are some good efforts. - The UX side of the, wallets, was a problem but i didn't think I was probably, the right person to be building you know, consumer facing wallets and there was some other good teams out there doing that um. So, eventually I kinda landed on, "ok well, we need to make sure these smart contracts are safe".

At the end of the day, people are going to put like life savings into these smart contracts, so how can we make sure that you can be comfortable doing that.  Um, and so smart contract coverage, Nexus Mutual, Sherlock, are kind of the bigger names in in that, in that industry. I guess even though it's still pretty small today, um, that's really important and then, you know we can get into how Sherlock eventually made its way into auditing and some of these other areas, too. That's a very interesting huh uh journey and, like, yeah trans formation of Tennis to tech to blockchain.



**Part 3: Deep Dive into Sherlock's Architecture and Auditing (49:30 - 1:27:00):**

Q: So Technical, did you also invest in crypto, like? Or you just look at it from the tech side was interested about the tech and the stuff?

A: Yeah, I invest a lot in crypto. Uh, I don't even know what to write how much of these things I got. You know life savingss in crypto, but it's an irresponsible amount for sure and uh, irresponsible and uh, you know.

Q: So, Sherlock's initial idea was that there are kind of, at first Insurance DAPP or platform
How do you make sure the smart conutracts are safe? 
I'm Just wondering

A: Yeah, So Smart contract Coverage.
And then you got to that part
Nexus Mutual, Sherlock are kind of the bigger names are the big 3 in that
that industry.

Those we still think are pretty small today.

Q: So now we have Sherlock was kind of, you know, the natural course. Kind of natural course and is going on to start asking questions?
what would you tell to Sherlock to make it real financial system?
actually, what are the Problems so that we work that? ok scalability. transaction transaction fees but these are some that that there are teams working in. Those are just a few of others that you did.

And how can Sherlock really achieve its leverage is and then it's. We're talkin about competitive auditting Contest with lead Watson to achieve max security background. So what does each of

A: so it was a you know technical was this a a deep thing now, that there is a code base for their own um protocol you and their first and.

**Part 4: Evolving Sherlock and the future of Web3 Security (1:27:00 - 1:44:00):**

Q: So, what is on the road map of Shellock? What are some features coming up to Sherlock?

A: So this is something I haven't talked a ton about it yet you know all of these are to you know for it to deliver this you know to work well I was going into some more to build. The point is at. You got to have these people to pull this way and like we're we haven't.

Q: OK so your first experience with Crypto 
technical experience or you started like investing or what is with a term, what is etherum and 
like SEO was like one when didn't start like getting getting in to I actually read ethereum? Uh.

A: so that so it it gives the ability it.
Defi the which kind of taken off again.
Like, no seriously way to improve with these new. Is there something.

Q: Before. Going to say one come to talk about?

A: It kind of depends.
Like, in the one of which for. I have two of the things. I mean that's entry point.

**Part 5: The Competitive Audit Platform and Watsons (1:44:00 - 1:53:00):**

Q: How are you to stay in the front?

A: to see those definitely um so when maximum security. Protocol what about the Web tree and we gotta share some maps, and coming up with that

I might lick so without.
So really, you don't really have to come with to help you? Is coming to achieve back to the so in my hand it really I'm in it's not so.

**Part 6: Jack's Vision for Sherlock and the Web3 Security in general (1:53:00 - 2:07:00):**

Q: So are you the one that comes with a design?

A: You got to talk to you. Definitely going to make it the more. Then. You know, we can get into how short you. It it.
Yeah.
My story.
No, one wants to do it is a small.
Thank you.
