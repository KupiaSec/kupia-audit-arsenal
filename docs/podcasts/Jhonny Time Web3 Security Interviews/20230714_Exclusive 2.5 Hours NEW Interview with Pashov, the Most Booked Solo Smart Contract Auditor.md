Okay, I'm ready to summarize the YouTube video "Exclusive 2.5 Hours NEW Interview with Pashov, the Most Booked Solo Smart Contract Auditor" based on the transcript you provided. Here's the summary in the requested format:

**Introduction (0:00 - 0:57)**

I am Johnny Time, and I welcome my audience to a special Web3 security interview. Today, I have a returning special guest, Pashov, known as the most booked smart contract auditor. I first interviewed him in October 2022, and now, many months later, I want to catch up with his incredible journey. I plan to share some tips about Web3 security, smart contract auditing, and hacking.

**Revisiting Past Goals (1:04 -8:32)**

*   **Q:** Last time we talked about your future goals. Let's revisit those goals. First one, taking care of your family financially, how is that going?

*   **A:**  I write down goals for myself every year, financial, lifestyle, friendship goals, and anything else. This was one of my main goals and it's pretty much done. Maybe even one or two years ago. I helped my mother and sister and they live a great life now in my hometown. Financial stability for myself and my family was the initial motivation to become a cybersecurity engineer. They are not people who want to flex with watches or cars, they are very well off even without much money.

*   **Q:** Another goal was public speaking and content creation. How is that going?

*   **A:** In terms of content creation. I haven´t missed a single day of tweeting since your last interview. It is close to a year now. Some days I am tweeting more than once. People follow me so they like my tweets. I run my Discord community. Lately, is becoming web3 security stuff.
    In terms of public speaking, is Okay for a third consecutive year. I did online webinar for my local for the local community here in Bulgaria about Web3, security related. I spoke about the different phases of product development and deployment life cycles and how to secure each.
    I should have applied to be speaker at defy security Summit that is in 3 days. But, the process to apply is not good, sometimes you have to submit your CV as an independent Security, I don't have a cv.
    There's still time, I might be applying for other public speaking conferences.

*   **Q:** Another goal regarding networking, meeting, and more people in web3security space. We're able to meet new people?

*   **A:** I am meeting a lot of people, online, on Twitter, Discord, and Telegram. People have invited me to some private communities where just an small group of researchers discuss some things privately. I have built friendships and relationships. I visited Eth Montenegro, it wasn´t the best conference but I met some, people. This week, I am going to Paris for 5 days to the EthCC conference, where I am going to meet more people than in the last two years.

*   **Q:** Another goal for the future was to visit new places like USA or Miami,Were you able to visit those places?

*   **A:** For the past 2 years I've been traveling at least once every month visiting some other countries since we spoke last time. I went to Barcelona, Nice, France, Monaco and Greece.

**Auditing Goals (8:33 - end)**

*  **Q:** You wanted to bypass the plateau that you reach, you said that you read some kind of plateau and you wanted to win a five-digit reward.
*   **A:** When we last talked it was exactly before I started doing solo audits, and two months after the interview, it happened, I got my first 10K payment. Therefore, I can say that goal was achieved. But nowadays, I´m not doing code arena or Sherlock contests.
* Q: I discussed it with Trust. He also started doing private audits. I asked: do you miss auditing contests? Why don't you participate anymore?
* A: It´s a better decision to do solo audits.
*   **Q:** What advice would you give to someone who doesn't know anything about Web3, or to a Security Researcher?

*   **A:** First, get started. Start with resources like Patrick Collins's course and Securium's boot camp, and reading a lot. Then, participate in contests. When you hit a plateau, switch between all these different resources. Finally, start doing real Audits.
You need to work to get experience.
