Okay, here's a summary of the interview with @krum for JohnnyTime, told from my perspective as Krum.

**Introduction**

Q: How are you doing, man?
A: I'm feeling good and great, it's a pleasure for me to be here and have a conversation with you about super exciting stuff.

**How I got introduced to Web3**

Q: How did you get into tech?
A: I started when I was in high school and remembered this specific story back then.
My teachers used to talk about this guy that graduated from my high school and started doing some IT-related stuff.
They said he already bought a new flat/apartment at that time and I was like: "How does he do this?".
I grew up pretty poor, I mean, I didn't have much opportunities. Then, I connected into the Tech space and eventually web3.
I was in university when it clicked to me and where I've got.

**What I studied at University**

Q: So you have actually a degree from a university from Sofia
A: Actually, I don't get my degree, I studied for 4 years and I dropped it in my second year because I started working for a company.
So eventually, I started doing web3, blockchain, and transmitted to smart contracts audit.

**Shift from traditional IT to Web3 and Blockchain**

Q: So who was the first guy who told you about blockchains and crypto
A: I was working at Nexo and building a centralized exchange, I learned a lot about exchanges, derivatives and financials.
After one year, a blockchain-developer told me that he was going to start a senior blockchain development job at a Remote company, working on Solidity for 120k $ salary, so It was very very interesting for me.

Q: Can you explain to our listeners Code4rena and Sherlock?
A: It's basically the same model, a platform where you have security contests time-bounded. So you have 7 days where you have a open code source repository for some smart contracts related to some D5 protocol. Then, you can upload this report on Code Arena. And if actually they find like one bug/vulnerability you are guaranteed to get some payout. But if it's duplicated, the rewards will be distributed in the person who submited first. The Rewards are very good, around 50K dollars is very big amount of money. Actually I got Spirit without and Ox security.

**Recent Successes and Current Involvement**

Q: So how is it going with Code4rena and Sherlock?
A: Great. First of all just as a small disclaimer, I'm not that advanced you're saying I'm killing it, but I'm just starting it. I think I have just passed the first beginner level which is great

**About Security Audit and Payouts**

Q: Can more than one person find and submit the same vulnerability?
A: What happens is that the tester thatâ€™s the Code4rena model gives value to the protocol by finding vulnerabilities and reporting these issues to them. Then, the auditor assesses it and judges them as valid. In that way the tester is directly responsible for fixing certain issues within the solidity code. If more testers identify the same vulnerability in the code, then the price associated with fixing that piece of code is split amongst the testers. If, however, a tester submits a vulnerability that is already recognised, by virtue of an earlier tester having submitted the same vulnerability, first, then the later tester will receive reduced recompense. This motivates and incetivises speed within the tester community.

Q: So it's good there is a lot of competition?
A: As an auditor you depend basically on a mix of skill and luck. But all what you control has too be juiced and everything needs to be your best, at maximum of your capabilities.

**The switch to Web3 security:**

A: So then I thought that that was what I was gonna do, because the amounts are extremely high on salaries. I found another reason to switch the thing with this security because there was no enough people to resolve those kind of stuff so after, as security is so important, I wanted to switch on that.

**Recent and Future Goals:**

My recent goal, as you said, was the four figure reward and next year is make five figures reward or get a partnership for Spirit DAO

Q: What are you thinking for future and recent goals on this space?
A: With those goals, I want to have more public speaking events I want to start helping people to get their salary and have also some financial and career goals too

**Hacks**

Q: Do you remember what was your first hack that you see related on web3?
A: I saw this vulnerability in some token that was using transactional origin for authentication, which was the first time I know when I'm in school that somebody earned money for those audits

**Excitement about Ox Security and Spirit DAO**:

A: it was exciting joining Ox and security and Spirit DAO and working to do better EVMs, it helps create more value

**Tools**

Q: What tool do you find to be helpful and or the best way to find bugs in solidity and auditing the code?
A: Mastering etherum is a fantastic book and highly effective at beginner levels. All that is needed after that is to use existing tools such as Slither and then apply these models to contracts being scrutinised. Even though certain protocols use EVM audits some companies actually then use cross-chain equivalents.

**Journey to Code4rena**

Q: So how was your experience on Code4rena and Sherlock?
A: I went a little bit prepared but they say that everything is free on the internet so you can get on Google Search read some information and learn everything so i went to this test and the test consisted of 60 questions in 50 minutes and the test was very hard

**Tips for newcomers**:

*   Start with the securing boot camp
*   Read a lot of high-quality audits
*   Be active

**Daily Routine:**

A: About daily routine, I don't like or believe on routines where you have to wake up at 5 o'clock make some activity that makes anything. If you want to learn or improve, your things will be done well in a more natural mode

**Impact of FTX and the Bear Market**

Despite negative events, it is believed that quality development can still mean a positive outlook to people and the general space on web3.

**It's time to go**

Q: And with the conclusion to finish, you want to say thanks or shout something?
A: I want to say thanks for everything and have been a pleasure been in the podcast, bye bye

That's a comprehensive overview of the interview, highlighting the key points discussed.
