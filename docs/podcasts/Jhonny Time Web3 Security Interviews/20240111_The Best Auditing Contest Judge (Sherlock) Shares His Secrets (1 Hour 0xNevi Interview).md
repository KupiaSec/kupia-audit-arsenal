Okay, here's a comprehensive summary of the "Best Auditing Contest Judge (Sherlock) Shares His Secrets (1 Hour 0xNevi Interview)" video, structured as a conversation between me (the interviewer) and 0xNevi (the interviewee), broken down by topic:

**Introduction (0:00 - 0:55)**

Q: Hey Nevi, thanks for joining me today! Great to finally have you on.

A: Glad to be here! Thanks for having me, Johnny.

**Nevi's Background (0:55 - 4:35)**

Q: So, let's start by learning a bit about your background. Are you coming from a technical background, computer science, cyber security, or did you jump straight into Web3 Security?

A:  I graduated with an engineering degree in July of this year (2023).  I don't really have any prior Web2 or Web3 experience.  I jumped straight into Web3 security early in March.

Q: That quick jump is impressive. How did you even find out about Code Arena, or Sherlock, or CodeHawks?

A: I found out about Code Arena sometime in early March through a post on Twitter (now X). After some basic intro in freeCodeCamp. I went through Patrick Collins' Hardhat course (used to be hardhead).That gave me a good introduction to Web3 security and the space in general. Then, I just jumped straight into the competitions.

**Nevi's "Aha!" Moment with Auditing and Smart Contracts (4:35 - 7:05)**

Q: When did you start auditing?

A: I started in February/January this year(2023), actively learning Javascript through freeCodeCamp and Patrick Collins' Hardhat course. When I looked up Karina Kina and saw they were winning a lot of prize money for some of the reports I read and they seemed like "hm" maybe I can understand that. Then I just join contests straight away. I was initially going to join Web 3 generally but somehow I came across Karina's post.

Q: So early wins in the auditing contests motivated you?

A: For sure. Got a few hundred dollars to start with just doing QA reports + Gas Optimization fixes. This gave me a really big moral boost. This is why for newer Wardens nowadays when they get their first payout, it's really not a lot of money anymore because there's a lot of competition.

**Core Skills needed to participate in CTFs (7:05-24:50) **

Q: What core skills would you recommend beginners sharpen in order to get better at judging contests? What is the minimal knowledge and what other courses/resources did you use?

A: One additional resource would be CryptoZombies. But I don’t know about that, it’s probably quite outdated already. But there's so many Web3 courses out there right now. Pick one of them and get started. When I got more advanced in this field - I chose to enter the Smart Contract Hacking course. That was a turning point for my smart contract experiences. Contra did a good job offering that course and has H head

Q: Ah H head...

A: CryptoZombie uh maybe it's like the old tutorial . But it's still very relevant because you really learn the Solidity syntax and all about Solidity and NFTs. a little bit and ERC tokens so it's pretty cool!

Q: So after the Patrick Collins bootcamp the Smart Contract Hacking Course provided a career shift really boosted your knowledge?

A: "H head" gave me a rally good introduction to web three security and web three in general. then i saw Kina so i said, "WOW", then I saw someone then I was going to explore free load camp. and then the Patrick Collins coarse. So for what is a lead judge.

**Tips for Beginners + Thoughts on The Evolving Landscape (24:50 - 38:10)**

Q: Thanks for walking us through your education. That’s super helpful for beginners wondering where to start. Can you share any tips for folks trying to break into this space and what's your approach classifying what is and isn't a 'correct' submission?

A: Yeah there are usually four different valid issues that are considered valid and that that has no value so yeah the criteria I use. The criteria I use is: Does it cause fund loss or a DOS or impact the code. The more complex bugs are mediums and highs are what the bot misses. So I like to go on Sherlock first, it helps with gas optimizations.
Then you started immediately getting results, This was a great career boost and really boosted your knowledge.

Q: So, as judging lane boards get tougher...what can new auditors do to increase win rates?

A: Understanding the protocol is going to be the bottom-up bottom-up to ground up then jump straight in it.

**Judges, Competitions, and Leading (38:10 - 53:10)**

Q: What did you find most appealing about becoming the one to stand up there to give the right results? How did your journey to becoming a lead judge start? How old were you roughly when you realized or thought "I could be a Sherlock Judge"? 

A: This whole topic of judging was interesting. It's a format learning. So after auditing I would want to get backstage in code arena and learn what not to do.

Q: Ah. Then once you got backstage in co arena someone offered you to participate in contents...

A:Yeah yeah I joined this competition. And then try to read the contract and started out like regular QA reports and gas optimization optimization. I started immediately getting results, and I was like wow. I'm very surprised now is also why you have me on the show people so people can see can get inspired

Q: Ah and so so it's a judge versus the lead judge the assess a judge and report the submission at the lead judges correct yeah basically get if the you want to get the most accurate results possible. Do you catgeorize the contest repo...

A: Well after that repo is compared together with Judge repal. Basically you want to get correct and valid, I am the one I wanted two correct, they could so oh yeah oh you guys are good at this and that you're turning point was really and to improve contract C experiences that's used to get in that that type of

Q: Yeah let's get further into contest leadership...

A: Yes, this point system and then you advance.

Q: Thanks for clarifying what judges look for and who decides what! What does it mean to be a judge - in 139 days + 12k payout of hours what have you concluded as your assessment with all those findings, all those hours, who am I trying to compare this is what you can't do .

A: the new to a judge is zero with it's gonna be more to learn it's a turning point for my I choose to enter your CLI this and what is you could say it's like an quite a bit for my you to get there's you get an contract attacking me to create some contact just to get back you

**Tips for "Hawks", "Sherlocks" & Coding (53:10-1:31:00)**

Q: Thanks for describing this "hacker" mind. Is your main focus Solidity, Rust, or do you even bother looking that deep because so many high profile reports are still missed across the space these days?

A: To get straight to what you need to get out it still can be there so much three causes out CA has Owen I mean say one of started I get got in I chose to enter I think it it turning experience because to attack you're talking to he gave to that transition The what do you can say you you find out now that's pretty It's still very to to you're going to

### Continued

Q: So how old are you again?

A: 25

Q:" at the age of 25 completely Started this year and you alrady have incredible, that's how they hired you. Because you get the most credible
"
A: that's all I was initially how was and
### Final things to remember to new wardens (1:31:00)
There is no prerequsite for judge anyone can do that

In Sherlock, they have some hard Rules, like QA or Optimizations that bots already have and will excluded the context
""You want new to be great and it's there to help and I'm gonna say more
The other thing requires flash and really flash re-entry ""



**Final Words:**
Nevi hopes this discussion offers everyone the most security in the space

Okay, that is a very detailed summary. Let me know if you need any adjustments or further refinement!
