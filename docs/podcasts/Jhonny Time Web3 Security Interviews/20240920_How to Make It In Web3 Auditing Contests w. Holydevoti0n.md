Okay, here's a comprehensive summary of the YouTube video "How to Make It In Web3 Auditing Contests w. Holydevoti0n," presented as if I were Holydevoti0n, speaking in response to the interviewer's questions:

**Introduction**

Q: Could you share your background in Tech and security?

A: Sure! I've been a software engineer since 2010, about 14 years. For the last three years, I've been focusing on smart contracts. I initially started with smart contract development and then transitioned to security. Additionally, I've also started three businesses: a mobile app development agency, a fintech company in Brazil (which we scaled and sold to a bank), and an app for storing sensitive media (which I sold to a British company after reaching thousands of daily users).

**Getting Into Crypto and DeFi**

Q: How did you get into crypto and what triggered your interest?

A: It started around 2016. I was working at my fintech company and we were researching new payment technologies. I began investing heavily in crypto in 2017, studying the fundamentals and buying different cryptos.

Q: Did you have any experience with DeFi protocols?

A: Yes, I started around 2021, using Uniswap, Sushiswap for staking, and Curve. Later I went to play with nfts and some defi games.

Q: Any particular interesting DeFi app that you remember, good returns or bad bag?

A: I was always afraid to lose money. I was investing mostly in Bitcoin and Ethereum. I had losses with Dogecoin and DeFi Kingdoms (which was basically yield farming). I'd estimate I lost about 30% on scam projects, but overall, my returns were higher than my initial investments.

Q: Were you curious about how these decentralized applications work behind the scene?

A: Initially, I started learning about smart contract development. As a regular user, I'd read the documentation and check if the project was audited, but I was also curious about the code. I realized the docs can be very well-written and trick you. I remember I look to Pancakes wap, Sushi Swap and Defi Kingdoms. Seeing that they used the Master Chef contract, which is a Uniswap V2 pool, made me sell almost everything in Defi Kingdoms.

**Learning Solidity and Smart Contract Development**

Q: Let us know a bit more about learning Solidity.

A: I wanted to transition to a smart contract developer role. I learned primarily from Patrick Collins' YouTube videos. After that, I worked on small projects and published them on GitHub (building tokens, recreating "Master Chef," interacting with Uniswap).

Q: What was your incentive behind learning this new skill?

A: It was everything: having a career in Web3, the potential of the industry, understanding how the contracts worked behind the scenes. Also, I joined hackathons to gain experience. I rebuilded the beefy finance protocol in a hackathon.

Q: Did you get any gigs or job offers?

A: Yes, I got a few offers through a platform called calyptus. But they werenâ€™t ideal (onsite, low pay). That's when I started considering web3 security.

**Discovering Web3 Security Auditing**

Q: How did you find out about Web3 security and smart contract auditing?

A: I researched online for Web3 jobs that would leverage my skills. I saw security researcher positions, and looked into auditing contests. I saw interviews with auditors on YouTube and your medium articles. Then I found this course.

Q: What advantages do you think there are of doing Web3 security?

A: First, freedom. No bureaucracy, no contracts. Second, working remotely. Being paid by value is also important. Also, I have a drive to build something meaningful and Web3 allows me to do that.

Q: What inspired you to enroll in the Smart Contract Hacking Course?

A: The quality of the initial content you posted. It was straightforward, easy to understand. I thought it was complex, but your approach was great. I saw the course was complete and would let me start contest right after. I did so and found my first medium severity issue.

Q: How did you manage balancing the course with a full-time day job?

A: There was no balance! I reserved a fixed time to learn, starting around 5:00 AM for five to six hours a day. I had no rest.

Q: What are the main things that you were taking from this course?

A: It provided the fundamental to start doing contests. The theory combined with the Hands-On part simulates a contest. The training in Hardhat, even if nowadays there is Foundry, was very helpful.

Q: Do you remember particular hands-ons?
A: There was one of the re-entrancy chapters that I couldn't see how to exploit it initially, because it was hidden. There was one about lack of input sanitization, that was encoded and allowed to steal all the tokens, but as I was new, I took me sometime.

**First Auditing Contest Experience**

Q: Can you share about your first experience participating in a contest?

A: I chose Code Arena because, at the time, it seemed the biggest and most reliable. It was open dollar, a new project. I submitted five reports and found some interesting issues. It was rewarding because I thought it would be much harder. I found a medium.

Q: Do you remember the issue you found there?

A: It was related to the governor contract from open zeppelin, it was not well written and there were somemis configuration that would allow to approve proposals straight away.

Q: The contrast motivated you?

A: Yes, It wasn't about demony it was about like been able to do it! A few months prior, I was frustrated with finding a Smart Contract Dev role, and already have my first results. It was not about the money at all was just that okay I already did uh a good start here!

Q: What was your first strategy when it comes to your first contest?

A: I read articles. I usually go through the code several times. Read the documentation and understand the project. I get the big picture and then I go contract-by-contract. The greatest results that I've ever had it's still using the same strategy.

Q: What do you do when you encounter a potential issue?

A: I use the Notes extension and customize the tags for different things (audit on question, "weak lead," "strong lead," solidity vulnerabilities). I leave a lot of notes and customize them.

**From $50 to Impressive Rewards**

Q: Your next contest was Cod Haw B talks beIN Talk part one you got a first place and you earned
$24,000 then you participated also in IM unify ebtc boost you claimed the third
place with $10,000 then you participated in banock bstock part two fourth place
1.5k bin stock H final contest you made another 19k claiming the fourth place
and also extra 4K in the community judging. How changed from $50 per contest to $24K

A: There was a gap between first contest and bean stalk. I had three contests when I hitted a wall, where I didn't find anything. After that, I need to learn fast and I wanted to see the report straight away. That is why I started using Canina, where I got the invite by you. I Started learning through the submissions that were missed. I would go through the codebase after and understand the submission. Also, I have a no notion tempalte putting all the learning there, what I missed and what I learned to re-review them

Q: What changed in Bean stock contest?

A: I paid much more attention to understanding the project first, and they had this Bouny Program on Immuni. They also went through a hack 2022. So this was a hard contest with a good opportunity for me. I started focusing on fuzzing as well a little bit, but I found it to hard when you are not going after a goal. In that case, I choose to go with it.

Q: Did you write fuzz tests for that contest?

A: Yes, I did. First, the code was on Hardhat, so created the step by step tutorial on how to use foundry with it. With less than 10min of fuzzing an invariant, I found an issue. The important thing here is starting with a lead. The invariant test fail when the oracle fails.

Q: How many report did you did you send?
A: There were only for medians in this contest and I found two of them. Also one were an unique code for worth $18.00.

Q: Why did you chose the immutify Ebtc boost contest?

A: Because it has heavily audited, where the guys working on it, are really advanced. Alex enterpeneur is a judge in cerina, so that I will learned a lot on best practices for invarints here. The point here, is that you have to focus on your own knowledge. So here I asked from them that they don't like or did not gave them much attention. Something that is not from liquity and is new here.

Q: Why choosing it, and give us an advice selecting a contest?

A: They are new integratons from Oracle. So as I don't have much time, so I focussed on the integration, and what I learned is, to understand what are the timings when going into a contest.

Q: Do you consider the writting Fuzz test, very important, or the findings came more from a manual approach.

A: I think in constest, is very, very important manual review. In the other hand, writing tests on, is very viable. When there is not a team restraint, you can have big restults on what the team will do.

**Looking Forward and Advice**

Q: What's your next adventure and goal?

A: I thinking on specialize in big topic such as a L2 solutions. On the long term, build my own defi protocol.

Q: What kind of advice would you giv e to beginners that are wacthing this Interview?

A: To really focus on your own development, and do not compare youself with another one. Get BETTER on every contest, make sure not to focus to tutorials only when doing it. So what I say to them is on the following words:
"In the end, see look at the submissions and see what you learn uh what you missed and learn with that."

Q: How can people reach out to you for questions?

A: You can reach out to me on Twitter @HolyDevoti0n and it's the same on Discord

That's a summary of my interview. I hope this proves helpful to those getting started in web3 security auditing!
