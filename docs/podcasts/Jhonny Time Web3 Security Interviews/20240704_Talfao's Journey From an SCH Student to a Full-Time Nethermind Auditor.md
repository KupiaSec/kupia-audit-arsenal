Okay, here is a comprehensive summary of the YouTube video interview "Talfao's Journey From an SCH Student to a Full-Time Nethermind Auditor", presented in a "Q:" and "A:" format.

**Introduction**

Q: Welcome, guys! Today we have Andre, known as Talfao is on the show.

A: Talfao was known best student in smart contract hacking course at Blockchain Security Academy, and worked with me on upcoming Cairo course. I'm super excited to dive into his journey.

**Early Cyber Security Experiences**

Q: To start, can you tell us about how you got started in cyber security?

A: In my country, we had a cyber security competition; kind of like a CTF. That helped me secure an application to my university. So, I started with normal web2 security.

Q: What Web2 security were you doing.

A: I was on internship in the red hat, offensive security intern, penetration testing in web applications and windows infrastructures. I also started with bug bounties where I found some issues in EDR providers. But I don't really like web2 bounties, because sometimes the triage people are not so good.

**Transition to Smart Contract Auditing**

Q: So you didn't like Web2 Bounties that much, you wanted something different,. Is that when you found smart contract auditing?

A: Yeah, I found smart contract auditing. Before that, I already knew blockchain - bought bitcoin, ether, done some DeFi, and had lost money, so I had it all figured out! (laugh). So I bought your course and I was interested because I heard about audit competition platforms.

Q: What attracted you to smart contract auditing at first?

A: It was very different from Web2 security, because web2 is about confidentiality, regulations. Crypto is all about being able to audit anything deployed and doing it any way you want.

**Smart Contract Hacking Course and Transition**

Q: So you get exposed to the course and started doing audit contests, then secure the internship at Nethermind... How long did that take?

A: I had a technical background in hacking and had been programming beforehand. I bought the course in May 2023. It was September/October where I got the Nethermind internship, so like 5 months alltogether.

Q: During those five months we were developing first competition where was a little tanks; Can you walk us through what the moment was for you?

A: Okay, I purchased your web3 security/audit course. Also I read some block post blog from valor or Carlos. bought the course, did the exercises. Then during the course I started the competitions, mostly on Sherlock. Also got the internship in Nethermind almost at the second story, so how long.

Q: A bit about your journey, what you can do with it and what is your opinion? What you should try to find this.

A: I didn't had the theory missing some parts. So I read some blog posts academically re-entrancy checking also insights from the audits that were on Twitter. I was not successful in the first one and still used your coding from you and what you want.

**Sherlock and Finding an Internship and the Experience working at Nethermind as Intern**

Q: After going through the course did you do a lot on Sherlock?

A: Mostly and pretty fast. I kind of got the internship in nether mind. I have this technical experience in hacking and hacking mind set and say. I start with you I bought the course in May year almost to years and yeah yeah, I had and year one year ago I and 2023 yeah oh is one year ago, you know

Q: What the competition you can just describe, like you mentioned is in internship?

A: In not sure like in the the competition is very different from security. in web just, like the bug bounties and penetration testing almost like by the services for just the companies and it was not like this.

Q: The service so for just by the company and know and public completion

A: I I know about and So after So yeah you know

Yeah Yeah yeah I was like I bought your course and I started like that and I was so interested yeah and the so I heard about Like Sherlock and it was web2 security.
