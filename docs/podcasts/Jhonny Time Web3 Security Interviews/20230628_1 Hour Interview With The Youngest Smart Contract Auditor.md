Okay, I'll provide a comprehensive summary of the YouTube video "1 Hour Interview With The Youngest Smart Contract Auditor".

**Intro (0:00 - 0:56):**

Q: Introduction of the guest

A: The guest is Chris, a 16-year-old smart contract auditor who earned $5,500 last month just by participating in auditing competitions and bounties within the Smart Contract Hacking Course community. As the Interviewer says, "It's crazy".

**Chris's Background, Early Start with Computers (0:56 - 2:33):**

Q: How did you get started with computers at such a young age

A: I responded that my start was unorthodox, it started when I was six or seven years old playing things like GTA. I started doing more interesting stuff like Minecraft and I believe that this was when the seeds were sowed to what would become a career.

Q: What kind of games did you play?

A: To be honest I started odd. I began with mainstream games and from those days, I actually began playing Minecraft like most kids.

Q: At age of 14 , what was your tech stack?

A: HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and a bit of Java. More than two years ago.

**Transition to Blockchain & Web3 (2:33 - 12:00):**

Q: How and when did you transition to the world of web3 and blockchain.

A: Since everything revolves around Minecraft, that's where I met people in the blockchain space. I then started learning first PHP

Q: So how did everything converge toward smart-contract auditing?

A: Well, back in October 2022, Pashov told me about smart contract security on Discord. I started learning Solidity. He said it's different from classic web2 hacking. I got involved with the blockchain security community. After learning Solidity, it made great sense.

**Smart Contract Hacking Course, Audits and Prizes (12:00 - 19:00):**

Q: What did you like about this specific course you were taking.

A: So he always promotes Web3 Security audits and that in itself was very interesting. I liked that it has a great community.

Q: How were you able to make $5,500 last month

A: By competing to earn money. To actually simplify processes toward someone learning solidity. Try to explain complex concepts and in terms where chat is for kid brain to understand

Q : As of the creation of this video, are you still involved in the course

A: Now, yes I am and I find it helpful.

**Mindset Shift (19:00 - 23:10):**

Q : What is now your new mindset

A: The Key For me was to actually not just write code but build and also breaking the code as we do it. When I first started with the course, there are a lot of complex spheres which, I admit, was extremely intimidating to me. But I had to change my mindset on the code and approach it from a "How can I break it now?" mindset

**The Importance of simplifying Information (23:10 - 27:00):**

Q: In essence, since you are still very young, does simplifying your information help your creativity

A : It helps to reduce the anxiety. Simplifying helps me think that like I had a friend and I need forward this information so, how can I make it most easy to explain so this information is easily digestable

**Career Goals(27:00 - 32:10):**

Q: Being only 16 what are your goals in 90 days or even in a year

A: Well, I do everything as I move. With having friends that are professional computer experts always gave me another perspective. Before being a security professional expert I just wanted to make a few websites. I then wanted to learn how to code a secure website and protect my own interest

**The Importance of Web3 Security and the Future (32:10 - 45:42)**

Q: Since you have been able to earn some money and you want to do this professionally where and when did you decide to really dig in in Web3 security

A : Well it was in a very natural way that I did proceed there. The catalyst to me actually pursuing this further was the Smart Contract Hacking Course. I met very talented people and in that, I thought that this could have some serious potential

*   From here. Chris mentions the importance of surrounding yourself with brilliant people as a way to get into Web3 Security and also to learn from them. Chris also highlights how it's important to use real-world analogies to better digest and understand certain complicated processes, for example, viewing crypto tokens as a form of digital metal or viewing a smart contract as a vending machine with the ability to perform more than one function. For the final portion of the interview, they focus their conversation around the importance of finding a healthy balance between auditing, learning, and creating content.

In short, the interview charts Chris's journey into Web3 security, emphasizing his early start, the role of community, and the unique blend of coding and adversarial thinking required for smart contract auditing..
