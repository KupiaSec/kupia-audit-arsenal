Okay, hereâ€™s a comprehensive summary of the Web3 Security Podcast episode featuring Nikita Varabei, the founder of ChainPatrol, laid out in a speaker's perspective, using the "Q: A:" format.

**Intro:**

*Greetings, everyone! Welcome to another episode of the Web3 Security Podcast.  Today, I have Nikita Varabei, the CEO and co-founder of ChainPatrol, with us. This is going to be an enlightening conversation packed with valuable insights.*

-   I think that main point is that, a lot of the money lost on Web3.0 is actually due to  fishing, scams, and Social engineer attacks rather, than Smart Contracts exploits.

**Q:  To start with background, can you give listeners a brief intro to yourself and ChainPatrol?**

**A:** *Sure. My name is Nikita, and I'm the co-founder and CEO of ChainPatrol. We're a security company focused on protecting communities in the crypto space from phishing attacks, impersonations, and various threats related to social engineering that can lead to malicious transactions or stolen private keys. We work with many top organizations in the space, like Arbitrum, Polygon, OpenSea, and others, to safeguard their communities.*

-   Before that, I was working @ Coinbase at the Wallet  Team. Also, I founded others startups.

**Q: Why did you start ChainPatrol and what did you noticed that give you inspiration?**

**A:** *Well, during my time at Coinbase I kept seeing user reports coming in about stolen funds, malicious transactions, or private keys stolen, I realised that a huge slice of people are facing these problems daily, so I wanted to improve that and give opportunity for the user to actually own this money and not controlled by other entities.*
*Because you know, with self-custody and ownership comes a lot of responsibility, something attackers are now taking advantage and once you get tricked  or fished, there's is no Blockchain text support, so I understood and realized it became my mission to protect the community from these kinds of attacks*

-I also think the more we can protect users for these kind of attacks, the more all crypto Ecosystem can grow. Right now I couldn't recommend to any parents or grandparents for a daily usage wallet"

**Q: You've come from an engineering background, Could you explain like with that background you identify main scam problem, compared to people who knows the product?**
**A:** *Right absolutely, so I think , it's in my background, because, you don't have like "Call center to PayPal or credit cards where you say hay please revert the transaction", for crypto is all self-custodial, also, scammers get even more sofisticated each day, for example using AI to generate messages and also deepfake, for those who comes from other backgrounds might be really hard to follow that tactics so with that engineering background i could do it.*

**Q: Tell a little more on how you founded the ChainPatrol company, in the past you said that it helps user funds.. how this technology works under the hood, and how can quickly respond to threats in the crypto space?**

**A:**
   - *ChainPatrol is all about real-time detection, this is a first step like having bots constantly monitoring your customers replies on social apps (twitter) looking for the malicious links, we run all kind of scans then we can determine if there's a scam. Also there's an team that's reviewing those and make sure that it's legit scam to not block the good sites, and automatically block list a lot of times. *But in relation of how does that magic works it's how we got it spread to users because we contribute automatically with the wallets API blacklist".

   -Also, we collaborate with Matamask for example, we look at the phishing dectection (how is called in there)

   -To better understand what's a main takeway: "you have to deeply crawl internet to detect each kind of attack, and if it's not, also have to classify and categorise. You must patrol the interned to protect users communities and make your work hard to attackers"

**Q: You stated that it saves and Protect user funds (milions of dolars), what numbers could say in that theme that you've been able to do?**

**A:** *The thing that we've focused to say is the ammount of detected thread because it was impossible to measure how much, like saved, but we can say that for example one day we took 1.5 Twitter accounts, was really high amount of attacks. Now the number that I want to point*is within about 30 minutes of them doing this um our are in almost all wallets, that ideal, is basically to block listings and get more and more quickly to make their life harder."

-   *If anything there I can I bring as a tip for viewers is that, a good point is always send us the uncloaked version of the scam, helps a lot*"

**Q: I get here some points from previous conversations, and I think it's important recap them to this new listeners, and those all connects to those fast response theme; Could you dig more on like 3 amazing things?**
 *A:** Yeah, definitely, so*

   1.  **The Sophistication of Scams:** *First off, scammers are becoming increasingly sophisticated. This requires being proactive and constantly adapting to their evolving tactics.*
   2.  **The Lack of a "Call Center" in Crypto:** *With crypto, there's no call center to reverse fraudulent transactions. This puts all the responsibility on the user to be vigilant.*
   3.  **The Problem of Private Key Theft:** *Private key theft is one of the biggest sources for loses, because it represents 100% lost without Blockchain text backup. The money's gone and that money can't reverse."*

**Q: From that point, to that point.. that must require a big workforce to maintain that constant monitoring to keep those stats that low, so let's talk about ChainPatrol, how big is, and how to reach them from this audience like Engineer/SmartContract/Devs?**

**A:** *Actually, the company staff now it's only over 20 people!*
"The interesting part as a coin base engineer is that the organization moves very qI think what really that I enjoyed about working there
was that this whole the company had to thousands of Employees, ut felt like startup. Um about how the way they organize people the way uh the west on and we honestly each person got a lot of to"
And I think that a interesting point was having a lot internal education and you needed to do a new thing as a user to undestand chain how it all worked.

It goes to Engineers-Sales team and other staff of how ChainPatrol is a great company.
