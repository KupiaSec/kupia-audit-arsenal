Okay, here is a comprehensive summary of the YouTube video "Parsely: zBlock1 Alumni @electisec on Learning ZK, Web3 and Solidity While Working Full Time", following the interview flow and using a Q&A format with core summaries:

**Introduction:**

*   **Q:** Is your current job related to security?
*   **A:** No, the interviewee works as a developer in the middleware space, focusing on connecting systems using primarily Java and an embedded language called EQL. Security is more of a personal passion.

**Early Journey into Security and Web3:**

*   **Q:** How did you get started with security, and how did that evolve into Web3?
*   **A:** The interviewee's interest in security began prior to Web3. They participated in TCM Academy's PNP course to understand security, after which they also engaged in offensive security and web2 bug bounties.. Seeing mention of Web3 through Parsley's podcast and tweets piqued their interest. He jumped into the practical ethical hacking side first.

**Experience with Y Academy zBlock:**

*   **Q:** How did you enter Y Academy's zBlock program, and what was the application process like?
*   **A:** The interviewee found the application process for zBlock highly competitive. He'd previously applied without success for Y Academy's Solidity block so was glad to get general access to the ZK block before later being properly onboarded.

*   **Q:** What were your experiences with the course material during zBlock?
*   **A:** The course structure was top-class with progressive approach which was great given he needed to brush up on maths. He thought that this progressive learning and maths elements helped in figuring out how zero knowledge works.

**Web2 vs. Web3 Security + Learning ZK**

*   **Q:** Web3 is newer than Web2 and has lots of new stuff to consider. Where does your caution come in as an ethical security researcher
*   **A:** The open-source nature of Web3 (smart contracts) allows anyone to see the code and easily scrutinize it by getting access to testing/production environments. The ability to audit the code made it a very exciting space as it differs greatly from Web2. The focus is on finding and fixing vulnerabilities before exploitation.

*   **Q:** How do the privacy aspects of ZK fit into your security passion?
*   **A:** For an older hacker learning zk/Noir it helps in the fact that the private element really was fun for me um and being able to prove something was also fun as zk was a great way to be involved again.

**Challenges of Learning While Working Full-Time:**

*   **Q:** What are the biggest challenges you face learning ZK and Web3 concepts with a full-time job?
*   **A:** balancing a full-time job coupled with a newborn was cited. He found solace in that the course was designed in a progressive way allowing him to do bits at a time.

**Time Management and Learning Strategies:**

*   **Q:** How do you schedule time for learning with a full-time job and family?
*   **A:** After the family is settled in the evening, he allocates time until about 10 PM. Weekend time is allocated as follows with Saturdays being mostly for self-study. After doing the family "bits", just before the 6pm - 10pm run, he will first get the most important things done to put himself into hyperfocus.

**Advice and Recommendations:**

*   **Q:** What advice would you give to others interested in learning ZK, Web3, and Solidity while working full-time?
*   **A:**

1.  Be prepared put in the hard work and go down numerous rabbit holes to make the correct decision. This is better long-term as there is no substitute for personal study.
2.  Recognize that it is hard and you can't just immediately jump in to compete in security protocols without understanding the math fully.
3.  Find something you love and which makes you happy as that is what will keep you going.
4.  Drip feed yourself little bit a lot so that eventually that will harden into muscle.
5.  Do all the study for yourself and make sure that integrity is maintained for you. Do not do two things and then make yourself feel bad later.
6. See if what is in the course and how they want to teach you. You need to understand how it will work and not just go in blindly.

    Other good resources can be the Y Academy Website but see Spearbit or Hacken as a solid first pass to take in. This does not guarantee everything will be right as everyone will have different resources/perceptions.

I hope this summary is helpful!
