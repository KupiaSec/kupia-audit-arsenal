Here's a comprehensive summary of the YouTube video in a Q&A format, following the interview flow and divided into parts according to context:

**Introduction and Background**

Q: Welcome to the show, can you tell us about what you will be sharing with the community and also yourself?
A: Happy to be here.

Q: Can you share your experience working as a Lead Security Researcher and your biggest takeaways in the security field especially Web3 contracts?
A: Glad to be here!

Q: Start from background
A: I would say I got interested a bit in crypto in high school. Then went to university studying engineering but then switched over to computer science.

Q: Recommend people to UNI these days and your graduation from UNI
A: It depends on the country you are in, but Unis these days are insanely high cost and often not teaching the skills needed for work. Foundations are always useful.

Q: Did you work for Sigma Prime during UNI and also paradigms etc?
A: Joined Sigma Prime at the start of 2020, working part-time and finishing studies, fully auditing in May 2021.

**Kodorino and Working on Code Arena**

Q: I see you did a Kodorino thing and that you started doing a bunch of Codeo Arena
A: I started doing a bunch of Code Area because we were in lockdown! How fast can I find issues became more the game.

**Experience at Spearbit**

Q: What is it like doing auditing at Sigma Prime? Do two Code Bases going at once make that hard?
A: Two code bases can be hard.

Q: How did you overcome the focus/concentration issues on many code bases and what was the difference being Kodorino and Sigma Prime (Spearbit)?
A: Two different things, with Kodorino it was a bit of a game, how fast can I find issues? Sigma Prime I felt I had more time to really dive in into things more. Each were beneficial.

Q: What do you optimize for now (high low medium severity)?
A: Used to only go for finding the unique findings, high hanging fruit. But now trying to look for highs / mediums, because they obviously can spend more time and dig into that.

Q: What percentage of time do you spend on Kodorino code arena?
A: Maybe 5-15 hours. I find it hard to find the high severity stuff because there is more competition. I saved al ot of time up by not trying to find any little small issues.

**Importance of Math and Understanding Code**

Q: What should be people studying in school these, days, Computer Science, Maths etc?
A: Probably math. I think that's really good.

Q: But there's definitely an advantage when it comes to auditing and the ZK coding and mass intensive things that you need math for?
A: Yeah, definitely. If you have math background you would have an area that you are very strong at. Lots of DEFIs are math heavy.

Q: Understand what they're implementing goes a long way. After Uni getting an internal ship with Sifma Prime
A: Yep, it definitely is like a different type of understanding, not rally just to break not rally really to understand properly

**Workflow as Lead Auditor**

Q: Now that you're a lead, do you handle multiple code bases?
A: No, I cant really handle that right now.

Q: How do you deal with switching code bases?
A: I think I just treated them differently, Code Area at the time was more of how fast can understand them. Prime time: dive right into them

Q: What has helped your auditing experience? 
A: Having workshops, helps for mentoring people. You never get a senior position by grinding on your own. What was helpful was that Spirit was to find LBRs also.

*You can't really find a mentor ship if people distrust you* It would also be helpful to find all of these gemini type traits early on in your career to progress. If someone could speed up that process thatâ€™d be it

**How Long Each Stage Takes** This section goes into the overall timeline from finding a bug and submitting report

**Newbies entering the space**

Q: What are your quick tips for newbies?
A: Find people to work with. If you have people around that can be very beneficial Too many people want to work by themselves to increase the team and skill level.

Q: What's your advice if you were starting now?
A: To be honest I would probably just major in maths.. Math and physics is an exciting good foundation. It's all like math heavy so yeah it's definitely an advantage.
