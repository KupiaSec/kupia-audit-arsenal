Okay, here’s a comprehensive summary of the YouTube video "Joe: Audit Wizard Founder, ex-FAANG Security Engineer on Threat Modeling, AI, Security Tooling," formatted as requested.

**Part 1: Joe's Background**

Q: What were you doing at Apple and Amazon as a security person on the project?
A: At Amazon, Joe worked in the central appsec team, auditing code for various teams. At Apple, he was embedded on a specific team and audited the majority of their code, thinking about potential security threats.

**Part 2: Threat Modeling and Operational Security**

Q: Talk to me a bit about Threat Modeling.
A: Joe believes security engineering is essentially threat modeling, going beyond application security and considering operational security. He emphasizes thinking about crazy scenarios and who has access to what, as well as how many people it would take to materialize an insider threat.

Q: Do you have an example?
A: An example of crazy thinking could be “what if aliens repel into the data center?” and other weird inputs. The main purpose of threat modeling isn’t that however, he found that their infrastructure engineers had far too much permissions, that's when one find some value if you do it right.

Q: What value did they added?
A: Actually found out that all of the assumption they had about hot to fix that where actually untrue.

**Part 3: Web3 Security and its Unique Challenges**

Q: Web3 is booming. Can you share how Security is there?
A: It's interesting that we focus too much on the smart contract side. So you need to look for the holistic operational security uh Right, like who have the keys all access to everything what combination of people does it take to materialize and insider that can just kind of walk away with some sensitive information like when you have time at your disposal you can start thinking of these crazy scenarios and actually some of them have some value you know infrastructure engineers that had way too much permissions.

Q: Tell me more of the Road and Bridge hacking and opsec. 
A: That's an example of how keys when properly protected was kind of an infrastructure failure, someone hadn't really put enough thought into what happens in these scenarios is that defense in depth there in place.

Q: The opsec security are violated, right? Traditional opsec?
A: Yes, it was not protected so assumptions not true.

Q: What is the focus we have in Web3.
A: I think we tend to focus in web3 in the application security, and that can really get you into trouble because most projects have some sort of kind of permission system where like they own the proxy contract there you know is like a small Quorum of people that update the contracts and they just push through versel or posted on AWS.

Q: Are all doing right?
A: Not really knowing what you're doing in terms of security compromise and entirety of the your project just speaking of front end and not so sure if you saw this but just literally 30 minutes before we jumped on Loadbalancer put out on tweet to don't interact it because our front end is getting attacked with it yeah it's pretty crazy.

**Part 4: The divide in security and industry shift**

Q: Is AppSec enought for web3.
A: No! in web3 is 90% Appsec it's all application security but there are lots that was forgotten like private keys compromise and infrastructure

Q: Is enough people are in the infracstructure area.
A; In the Web 3? No.

Q: Freelancing and Web 3?
A: Before starting doing what I'm on now I wanted to break the 3 space as a Auditor and I was on a Freelance working, while I was learning this uh smart contract after of things so I could go from Web 2 into Web 3. My operational security knowledge was not that diferent between the both.

**Part 5: The Audit, security tools and AI**

Q: From the current tools right now, what are you finding.
A: The main issue in Audits is writing reports, the craziest of of then a core what happens and I actually some value like found that I think we found you know infrastructure engineers that have way too much permissions.

Q: The tool are not what it needs to be, Right? What tooling did you have at apple and amazon and what's still not available here/
A: I'm using so.Yeah! The biggest thing that people would be surprised about when you kind of peak under the hood at not just people tend to focus in in the web free application security. Web 2 got Network Physical operational and appsec are a lot less you to focus web free space but I just on the application security and that can really get you in trouble. It's also what I saw kind free companies like the tooling is is there is no one really takes the time to secure their cloud infrastructure and that can happen. So it is that there a defense in depth in place.
So, but again it depend the case. What will we do with AI? You can't get from that

**Part 6: Auto Wizard and wrap up: The Future and Conclusion**

Q: You will start you're oqn security company, what value Auto Wizard will offer?

A: I'm Automative that is is no not just web free free companies, but companies in general that no one really takes the time to secure their their their Cloud infrastructure because well like the future is going to be more tools and that should probably Network security infrastructure security physical security uh operational and AppSec and and these things kind of get more or less equal attention and and that's is when things tend to happens so so yeah so I think people tend that had access to the front end so it was like a contract or something just added some code.
So and then speaking and front end interface it's right and that's they easy like you spend all our time focusing on the smart contracts security side but they're just want aspect whole ecosystem like in uh in the figure space I feel like we've gotten a little lopsided uh when you think about like Web 2 you've got uh network security infrastructure physical security operational security and appsec so um before I started what I'm doing now uh I wanted to like break out in the web 3 space as an auditor of sorts uh doing freelance work and that would those gaps failed I was kind of applying my operational security knowledge there's not really much of difference between web 2 and web3 sec concepts so I actually started doing some opsec reviews for different web 3 companies. 

Is there anything else you would like to know or clarified?
