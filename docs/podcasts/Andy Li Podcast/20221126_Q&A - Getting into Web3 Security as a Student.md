Okay, here's a summary of the provided transcript, formatted as requested.

**Introduction:**

*   **Q:** Could you briefly introduce yourself (background and how you got into Web3 security)?
*   **A:** Currently in my third year of university. Started coding around 15 years old, always loved building stuff. Got into security by watching YouTube documentaries and experimenting with Kali Linux and Wireshark. Stumbled upon Solidity and found it similar to JavaScript, became interested and eventually discovered Web3 security was a good field.

**Journey into Solidity and Web3:**

*   **Q:** (Implied: What was the path you took to Web3?)
*   **A:** In UK crypto started becoming popular. Started researching blockchain and crypto, then two and a half years ago at university, stumbled upon Solidity. Found similarities with JavaScript and salaries were better than Web2, motivated to go deep dive into the rabbit hole.

**Finding Opportunities and Mentorship**

*   **Q:** How have you found opportunities and guidance in a relatively new field.
*   **A:** It started with freelancing and networking but CoVID made remote working popular. That motivated to deeper rabbit hole. I met you at university, and we have learned together, contributed to GitHub, freelanced. I attended the Chainlink hackathon where I became champion. Got an internship with Zach (a developer advocate at Chainlink) who mentored me for a year.

**Blockchain Security Society and Developer Advocacy Role:**

*   **Q:** Tell me about the blockchain security society at your university and your role as a developer advocate.
*   **A:** We are the biggest blockchain society in the UK. In the advocacy I run smart contract and hackaton workshops for Chainlink. Sergey has retweeted and it was the first time we were at the eyes of Chainllink Uh employee.

**Code4rena and Auditing:**

*   **Q:** Let's talk about auditing, can you give a brief introduction and how that works as well.

*   **A:** We organized a free small contract workshop and then an in-person smart contract event that has been retweeted by even Chainlink CEO. We had free and one-week for small contracts for free and workshops all around contributing at GitHub also. After all that, started the path into auditing by doing the following, learn about chainlink, do freelancing, contribute at GitHub and after all those efforts try to take the next step.

**Advice on Code4rena and Getting a Job:**

*   **Q:** Do you have any specific questions about code arena or how to get a job?
*   **A:** Focus on one particular bug type. Try out what companies were doing and focus. The key is do one great deep dive.

*   **Q:** Any other advice you can offer now in hindsight.
*   **A:** Keep going with that level since it will get you a great opportunity with a black hat mentality.

**Key Advice and Insights to share**

*   **A:** Just do solidity and JavaScript to have web free skills. You should focus on the hacker to get more opportunity than development because I feel like the black hats is always gonna find a easy opportunity for his malicious hacking,
*   **A:** Do code arena or hackathon and keep learning then you are ready for a good opportunity especially the coding area is really important by.
*   **A:** Get yourself in that career for white hacks.
*   **A:** If you did the deep dive you probably going to network. Have as much videos because that is really important.

**Deeper Dive on Code4rena**

*   **Q:** Could you talk a bit more about Code4rena and your experience participating? How easy is it to get started and what are your thoughts?

*   **A:** It's not that hard we're just looking.

    We can find different bugs based on different countries and countries, find Linux and wire shark.

**Tyreeseâ€™s experience and advice**
*   **A:** Just research the blockchain, we can build university. Join the discord server. Do the largest free workshop online. Most of the time as Patrick Collins.
*   **A:** Watch is the first in-prison and Patrick Collins does the brilliant workshops online. I watch of his lot of videos. I try to do one free of the contracts per week. Patrick did retweet me again. 
*   **A:** I just to be the developer advocate after years. You will have opportunity.
*   **A:** We can do for about and small contract workshop which is one of their time because most most of them are online you know.
*  **A:** Also the salary is well as well. Was better than web2 and I got my yeah like this is really really like this is really great also when covert came and brought remote working was really pushed.
*  **A:** When I started learning that but digital nomads and stuff stuff like that like it really motivated me to just go deeper down the rabbit hole.
*   **A:** I started doing a lot of validity development. I fell in love with the lady because it's so similar to JavaScript. 1800 thoughts this is crazy. Uh additionally to that sort of salaries as well was better than web2.

**Tyreese and The Interviewer journey towards security**

*   **Q:** What was about the two journeys so far before we go.

*   **A:** You learn solidarity in middle of lock down You made Laurens. You were leaning and doing open source project on GitHub etc. And people needed about launchpad, ERC token, etc so it was like like really good money it was so I enjoy and I learn about it. Because from I knew and two was just like office work and it's kind of like backhand you and I didn't and she didn't see a lot of that's it

*   **Q:** Any thoughts.

*   **A:** So Sergey so are we doing it and uh it was pretty good for the first time and then um we started getting partnership and and really start to network with all different people and I joined a Chainlink hackathon.

**Specific Advice on Code4rena and Securing a Job in Web3**

This was about something that's similar but there's something building it and then you know if you just follow the code that comes to this crazy to get you you follow.

**Further Explanation on How to Approach Code4rena**

*   **Q:** Any other things to consider

*   **A:** For me I was about python SQL all lot stuff and this was obvious I come to it. But that makes sense but its was easy I really just programming to so um um just really you are so many about the different countries and attack like a Linux completely fell really, I was not in the school at Education and I didn't really see as much opportunity thought there's just different kind in in good for bad for about four,I want to to a good opportunity that stuck.
