**A:** He has a background in ethical hacking, specifically in Web 2.0. He couldn't resist transitioning into Web3 security.

**Part 2: Comparing Web2 & Web3 Security**

**Q:** How do you compare the two?

**A:** The worlds of web2 & Web3 are completely different

*   **Web2:** Security is sequential with a more established methodology.
*   **Web3:** There are so many things jumping from one contract to another and are picked up for value maximization. Need to think spatially way more.

**Part 3: AI and Security**

**Q:** What sort of AI's that you work with back then and has it improved a lot nowadays?

**A:**

*   Initially focused on ethical hacking in Web 2.
*   Joined an AI team at a bank, motivated by fearing AI's potential threat.
*   Uses AI to automate vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, but avoids using public or "off-the-shelf" AI models/tools. It is important to develop proprietary one, but not everything can be automated.
*   Developed models in-house, combined with graphs. He feels this approach is spatially different than in Web 2. This a transition between that one.

**Part 4: Startup's Differentiator & Challenges in Web3 Security**

**Q:** It was quite tough in fact I remain differentiator.

**A:** His Pen Testify startup's differentiator: it combines his deep knowledge of both AI & blockchain/Web3 security. and automate the process.

**Q:** And were you to talk a little about the challenges that you see around the blockchain infrastructure side of Web3 auditing and so on, where's that is very underdeveloped now in terms of market.

**A:** Web3 is underdeveloped for auditing with a whole spectrum unfulfilled and needs lots of trust and recognition with people's reputation and market.

**A:**

*   Finding independent clients is tough, requires connections. Approach directly wasn't enough.

**Part 6: Navigating AI's Role & Skills for the Future**

**Q:** What is his perspective on the rise of "open" AI and general purpose AI tools?

**A:** Thinks their only undervalue is how scary people were wasn't actually that was, that was kind of the underlying how literal people were scared about the technology and then you want to put him on it. AI is a very overhyped, underdog. Can't apply that in the real world.

*People cannot trust AI because AI has a lot of responsibility to hold*

**Q:** What are the skills should a smart contract auditor has so his/her stills can be upgraded and still relevant and more efficient with AI?

**A:** It starts with the base first ethical hacking then you also need to know quite a bout Ai and automation so for and keep in pair with both of them.

*   Avoid trading time for money always.
*   The point of trading is creating solutions that do not exist.

**Part 7: Final Thoughts and The Future**

**Q:** What is your final thoughts that are good?

**A:**
