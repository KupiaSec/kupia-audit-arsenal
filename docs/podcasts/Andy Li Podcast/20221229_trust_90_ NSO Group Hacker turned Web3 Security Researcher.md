**Introduction:**

*   **Q:** Expressing excitement to have trust_90 on the podcast due to his diverse background in cybersecurity.
    *   **A:** Expressed pleasure to be there and thanked the host for the invitation.

**Background and Early Interest:**

*   **Q:**  How he started tinkering with tech & hacking from a young age & his path into the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces).
    *   **A:**  His Dad taught him programming young, became an extracurricular school program. Interested early in physics, math, and computer science. Interest in security came later.

**IDF and NSO Group Experience:**

*   **Q:**  Journey from high school to the IDF. Research & development in the IDF, eventually leading to NSO Group.
    *   **A:** Joined after high school. Required extra years of service. Describes the experience as amazing. He gained substantial reverse engineering and low-level hacking skills.

*   **Q:** Describe what it's like to work in the IDF/NSO for research?
    *   **A:** Depth of knowledge that's required is amazing. Surrounded by talented people wanting to fix impossible challenges. Was able to get a good education reverse engineering and low-level exploits. Always surrounded with talented people that want to bring the best of themselves to solve those challenges.

**Transition to Web3 Security:**

*   **Q:** Catalyst for switching to Web3 security research - what triggered this career shift?
    *   **A:** Wanted to be independent. Saw massive bug bounties in Web3, recognizing his exploit dev skills could be applied.

*   **Q:** Transition from being an exploit developer to an auditor in Web3. Thoughts on the current maturity of web3 security landscape.
    *   **A:** Traditional security was more mature. Enjoyed the algorithmic/analytical look at code that Olympiad training developed. The depth to understand the system deeply. Did fair bits of preparation & started learning. Hacking and networking was really fun.

**Web3 Security Differences & Challenges:**

*   **Q:** Web3 Security is still quite unique, can you expand on other points of the change?
    *   **A:** You have the freedom to understand the general concepts. I wasn't aware of it beforehand and I recruited as a result. Most of what he was doing, he couldn't really share but the knowledge in research and development is amazing.

*    Â **Q:** What are some differences on code look/style in WEB3 now?
     *    **A:** Now we get Solidity, a higher form in terms of source code. With deep knowledge and experience one can take an analytical understanding and a good grasp on all these concepts.

*   **Q:** How is code review & problem solving different than Web2, as the industry has very new aspects as a whole?
    *   **A:** Always needed because more and more people are interested in Web3. The parents actually gets this trend for themselves, to push up their children early. One needs to know what the trend is impacting on their knowledge - I can take a technical skill, now.

*   **Q:** Specific technologies & challenges seen so far in Web3 security?
    *   **A:** So many new technologies are involved that set you up for the tech sector later.

    *   **A:** I can't really talk about it much, the depth of knowledge required to do the work it's amazing and you're surrounded with talented people.

*   Have a grasp of all the concepts;
*   See where you are able to get to a solid base;
*   Follow the documentation, try to break it apart;
*   Always surround of talent;

**Tips for Aspiring Web3 Security Professionals:**

*   **Q:** General tips for new guys getting into the space.

*   **A:** A tip would be to start learning and try the field (a bit more of this below):
    *   It's about a better to get some CVS;
