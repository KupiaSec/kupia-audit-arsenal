         "Q:": "Javi's background and current Security Research role.",
         "A:": "He started participating in Code4rena in 2021 and is now a Security Researcher at Spearbit and continues contributing to Code4rena, focusing on contest scoping and pre-contest communications."
      },
      {
         "Q:": "When did you start with auditing?",
         "A:": "Javi started looking into smart contract auditing around late 2021, acknowledging it was already a somewhat late entry point but still early enough."
      },
      {
         "Q:": "First contest experience",
         "A:": "His first contest was in the last week of 2021 and that learning about web3 security came from Bug Bounty."
      },
      {
         "Q:": "How did you started with learning about web 3?",
         "A:": "Web2 Bug bounties were higher paid. It led Javi down the rabbit hole, following Michelle on Twitter that writes blog posts detailing how to start as an editor; with a link to the Code4rena documentation. The documentation states they pay for duplicates, which sets it apart from other typical bounty programs in a crowded market."
      },
      {
         "Q:": "How did you find and start learning to compute to Codearena?",
         "A:": "He used a Security Resource called Secureum after C4's Epoch Zero boot camp with Ox Taylor in the C4 discord laid out how to start from scratch and was well-laid out in a great reference source. In the mean time, participated in C4 audits but not scoring well and eventually breaking $600 USDC within one audit. In his first week doing audits he earned over 1k on reports."
      },
      {
         "Q:": "How did you manage working through those reports?",
         "A:": "He confessed previously as a learner with Rajiv (nice voice) and fell asleep a lot (10 weeks instead of the anticipated 8 weeks.). For 30 hours a week, the material was dense and gives you the foundation you need."
      },
      {
         "Q:": "Transition after securium and the first success",
         "A:": "After Secureum Javi wasn't sure how to approach Code Arena and read their documentation and saw amazing that if you report something - even if others got before, you still get paid for duplicates."
      },
      {
         "Q:": "After a first wave of success what’s the next recommendation?",
         "A:": "The biggest advice is when reaching a new knowledge level/stage is that you have to work on your team."
      },
      {
         "Q:": "What has been this key to help get past the learning curve faster?",
         "A:": "It´s when telling things in your own words, you summarize things in a way to help to help you learn"
      },
      {
         "Q:": "What was the thing that helped you more?",
         "A:": "Security 101 at first was amazing but too abstract - by only reading them I couldn’t learn things - it’s important to reformulate what things are about - explain security to a mentor. That makes it easier to go down the rabbit hole to yeah."
      },
      {
         "Q:": "Do you have advice for breaking through the plateau?",
         "A:": "Just continue on your journey. You talked about repo um that that you sent to people you send to me and uh yeah that was actually my first message on discord like asking how how should I get into this and what learning resources I should look into and you sent me that get up repo and I went through that and that was really, really helpful for myself like I I already knew about Secureum at the time before but uh I wasn't sure if I should really like go through the."
      },
      {
         "Q:": "Can you give advise for more intermediate people? How do you keep on improving on Codearena?",
         "A:": "He says documentation and community was very important to be in. Do a good job but they are old boys so you have to know your process - you really invested myself a lot- have to love this amazing space. Because the more I was The thing is better if I talk about how I started how I learned about web free."
      },
      {
         "Q:": "When I talked about what I recommended the most was to have some code base. We touched base last time at a high level what do you mean? You have said it’s not the best."
         "A:": "After SecureUM, Code Arena is next. He didn’t do it well at first until he started the automation - that’s when you shared our first videos."
      },
      {
         "Q:": "What helped to perform so well?"
