**Part 1: Introduction and Background**

*   **Q:** Introduction of Jacob Lawson and the topic of discussion.
    **A:** Jacob expresses his looking forward to the conversation.

*   **Q:** Jacob's current role and how he got into cybersecurity.
    **A:** Jacob works in GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance), has been in the field for four years, and consults at the same company as the interviewer.

**Part 2: Jacob's Path Into Cybersecurity**

*   **Q:** How did Jacob specifically get into GRC?
    **A:** He fell into it by chance. He initially studied counterterrorism, security, and intelligence, aiming for a career in counter-fraud.  He discovered cyber security as a fascinating major within his degree.

*   **Q:** Background on university and cyber degree.
    **A:** Hated software engineering at first; now realizes coding understanding is valuable, even in GRC. Chose cyber security major, loved understanding attacker methodologies.

*   **Q:** Continue on the path and how Jacob got his first role
    **A:** Chose to do an internship after the course. Got offered a full time position after three month internship, at first he said he want to do digital forensics but accepted a role in GRC.

**Part 3: The Importance of Networking**

*   **Q:** How difficult was it to find that initial internship?
    **A:** The university was very helpful with industry connections. However, he approached the specific company directly. He met someone at a charity dinner who was starting a consulting company, and he reached out, leading to conversations and eventually the internship.

*   **Q:** Summary on the previous point.
    **A**: Jacob landed the role via a live event, highlighting importance of seizing such chances.

*  **Q**: Is this a common approach?
    **A**: It was luck for him to meet the right people, but emphasize that *networking is crucialâ€”50% of the battle*.

*	**Q**: How to not approach someone asking for a role?
    **A**: Don't only ask. It is about building relationships, questions, showing passion, and that you want to learn.
    
**Part 4: The Competitive Cyber Security Job Market**

*   **A:** There are many graduates and online course completers, but relatively few entry-level positions, making the initial job search very difficult, *especially for those pivoting from other industries*.

*	**A**: A degree or certification is like a "tick of confirmation," but conversations are as essential.

*   **A:** In Australia, there are many events (conferences, networking nights).  LinkedIn is also crucial for reaching out.

*   **Q:** Confirmation from interviewer that many people end up having a radomn path to cybersecurity
    **A**: "Randomness factor" is involved. You need to put yourself in positions to meet people.

*  **Q:** Confirmation.
    **A**: University students often don't seek networking and that is why the majority doesn't secure a role after graduating. Start looking "six months before" finishing studies.

*   **Q**: How much is valuable a resume?
    **A**: Only so much can be gleaned from a resume.  Familiar names (from networking) can make a difference.

*   **Q**: What matters other than technical skills?
     **A**: Attitude, approach to learning, and communication skills are incredibly important, especially for GRC roles.

**Part 5: Developing Soft Skills**

*   **Q:** How can people develop those crucial soft skills?
    **A:** "Exposure therapy" is key.  Get involved in community events, present at university, put yourself in uncomfortable situations to build confidence.

*   **Q:** Is it easier to develop soft skills online?
    **A:** It's harder online.  "Live exposure" is essential for developing the ability to speak and connect with people.

*	**Q:** Confirmation that putting oneself out and being social are helpful.
    **A**: Emphasizes the "spectrum of people" and the need for continuous self-improvement. No degree can substitute real practice.

**Part 6: Career Progression and Leadership**

*   **Q:** Jacob's recent promotion to management and how his day-to-day has changed.
    **A:** The change is more in the "way you operate." Still involved in leadership and mentorship. Now, also manages complex projects with many stakeholders.

*   **Q:** How did Jacob learn these leadership concepts?
    **A:** He emphasizes learning on the job.  He mentions reading books (like "Radical Candor") and listening to podcasts, but stresses observational learning and having a good mentor.

*  **Q:** Advice for managing a team
     **A**: Providing clear, concise and actionable feedback is essential.

**Part 7: Degrees, Certifications, and Advice for Job Seekers**

*   **Q:** Is it worthwhile, skill shortage exists, etc?
     **A:** For young people (18) considering a cyber career, a degree is *not absolutely required*, but be prepared for dedicated self-study. For those already in other industries, self-study may be more practical.

*   **Q:** Is the Cybersecurity degree worth it?
    **A**: A degree gives more networking opportunities, but at this point in Jacob's career, a Master's wouldn't be worthwhile

*   **Q:** Advice if struggling to land an entry-level role.
    **A:** Be reflective. Seek feedback from interviews, even before knowing the outcome.  Focus on communication and showing genuine interest.

*   **Q**: Is there a skills shortage?
     **A**: Not a skills shortage, but an *experience shortage*. Companies want people with some experience, even for entry-level roles.

**Part 8: GRC vs. Technical Roles**

*   **Q:** Which path (technical vs. GRC) should someone choose?
    **A:** It depends on the person's preferences.  GRC is "business-oriented," focusing on risk management and compliance.  Technical roles are hands-on, but GRC roles can provide a broader understanding of the cybersecurity field.

*   **Q:** Confirmation from interviewer the GRC is more business oriented.
     **A**: Says it maybe a bit easier to get into, but the skillset is different.

*   **Q:** Is it easy to switch between roles with some experience?
     **A:** It's much easier to move from GRC to a technical role (or vice versa) *after* gaining some experience in *any* cyber security role.

**Part 9: Personal Branding and Networking**

*   **Q:** The importance of a personal brand and networking.
    **A:** It is important to building relationships.  There are "internal" and "external" brands.  Internal branding is about your reputation within your organization.

**Part 10: Jacob's Future Career Goals**

*   **Q:** Jacob's future career aims.
    **A:**  He's currently studying for the OSCP. His long-term goal is to pivot into a more technical role, possibly in security engineering. *He doesn't necessarily see a management-only path for himself.*

**Part 11: Fun facts and conclusion chat**

* **Q:** The origins of cyber security.
  **A:** Started playing RuneScape, in 2012 someone offered him money for gold in the game, then his first transaction got reversed. The game gave him insights into "black hat community", social engineering, and made him interested in the field.

* **Q:** End of the interview, thanks Jacob by coming in
  **A:** Jacob expresses he is happy to contribute.

Key Takeaways:

*   **Networking is Paramount:**  Meeting people, building relationships, and getting your name known are absolutely essential for breaking into and advancing in cybersecurity.
*   **Soft Skills Matter:**  Communication, attitude, and a genuine interest in learning are just as important as technical skills, especially for entry-level roles.
*   **Experience Over Credentials:** While degrees and certifications can be helpful, practical experience (even self-taught) and the ability to demonstrate skills carry more weight.
*   **GRC is a Viable Path:** Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) roles can be a good entry point, particularly for those with a business or communication-oriented background.
*   **Continuous Learning:** The cybersecurity field is constantly evolving.  Commitment to ongoing learning and self-improvement is critical.
*   **Be Adaptable:** Be open to different roles and paths within cybersecurity.  It's a broad field, and your interests and goals may change over time.
*   **Don't Be Afraid to Ask:** Ask for feedback, seek out mentors, and don't be afraid to put yourself out there.
*   **Have Realistic Expectations:** Entry-level roles are competitive. Be prepared for a potential pay cut if switching domains, and prioritize learning initially.
*   **Don't just be a tick box**: In this industry many people have degrees or certifications, it does not really means anything. Making the difference by showing you know more and are passionate.
* **Research the institutions**: Study the different educational alternatives in detail. The name, the subjects and courses, the teachers, the resources.
