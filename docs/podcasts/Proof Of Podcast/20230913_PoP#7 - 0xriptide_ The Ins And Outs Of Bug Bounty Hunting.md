## PoP#7 - 0xriptide: The Ins And Outs Of Bug Bounty Hunting - Summary

This is a summary of the interview with 0xriptide, a Solidity bug bounty hunter.

**Introduction (0:00-0:15)**

*   Q: Can you please introduce yourself?:
    *   Core Summary: The host asks 0xriptide to introduce himself.

*   A: Riptide:
    *   Core Summary: Introduces himself, mentioning alias and main activity (Solidity bug bounty hunting).

**Background and How Riptide Became a Bug Bounty Hunter (0:15-54:71)**

*   Q: What is your background, and how did you become a solidity bug bounty hunter?:
    *   Core Summary: The host asks about Riptide's background and how he entered the bug bounty hunting field.

*   A: DeFi Degen -> Rugged -> Learning Solidity:
    *   Core Summary: Initially a DeFi user who got rugged, sparking an interest in understanding smart contracts. Saw low bounties, large potential rewards, and a chance to obtain a new skill set.

* A: 10 Years Since Last Time Coding and Initial Devotion:
    * Core Summary: hadn't coded in ~10 years but fully committed himself, living off savings, to learning Solidity and bug bounties.

* A: Confidence Boost From Initial Rewards:
    * Core Summary: first $1000 bounty after 3 months was a huge validation, solidifying belief in eventual success.

* A: From Web2 to Solidity Bounties:
    * Core Summary: Saw low payouts for web2 vulnerabilities and high payouts for Solidity vulnerabilities, making it worthwhile. Was not cool, so started learning
**Time to First Bounty and Hitting a Stride (1:42-1:51)**

*   Q: How long did it take to start seeing results?
    *   Core Summary: The host asked how long it took before Riptide got his first bounty.

*   A: Three Months to First Bounty -> Arbitrum Stride:
    *   Core Summary: Took around three months to get first $1000 bounty. On Arbitrum he found stride and got a good cadence. Been finding almost 2 bugs/month.

*   A: The Journey with Solidity and Started Learning:
    *  Core Summary: Began with limited programming knowledge and experience. Took about six months of grinding learning solidity.
**Edge (1:54-2:11)**

*   Q: What Gives You an Edge as a Security Researcher?
    *   Core Summary: Asks what gives Riptide an edge over other security researchers.

*   A: Curiosity and Background => IBM Teenager, switched to Banking but resurrected old skills as been laid off.
    *   Core Summary: Cites curiosity as a key element. Also, the technical background is when he was a teenager.

**Selecting a Bounty (Wallet, Codebase...) (2:11-2:33)**

*   Q:  Do You Select Bounties Based on Wallet, Codebase and has any sort of criteria in order to choose?
    *   Core Summary:Asks about project selection criteria (wallet size, codebase quality, etc.).

*   A: Awaited Time Open, Community Size, Intuition + Pattern Matching = Easy/Lucky Bugs; Also duplicate vulnerabilities that are always there in that process!
    * Core Summary: Riptide states for him to focus his edge is that looking into different community is very easy, because he finds "pattern matching, stuff like that..."

**Techniques and Workflow (2:33-3:06)**

    *   Core Summary: The host asks what type of method and stuff Riptide uses to look into stuff.

*   A: Experience => Look at Each Line of Code & How Each Impact Another:
    *   Core Summary: Relies on experience now and his ability to understand the underlying code of solid programming.
      Experience is building up.

*   A: Think Different and Reading Code because Different Implications:
    *   Core Summary: The ability to think out-of-the-box and understand how the difference affect 2 levels down. He sees a lot of dupes, so the reading helps the code to not pattern match type bugs.

*   A: Just Experience Just Buidling Up:
    *   Core Summary: the just is building and building in the experience of the code of the contract. He is in a good level where he can read the code easily.

**On Remote Work and the Nomad Lifestyle (3:06-end)**

*   Q: Any suggestions from scratch?
    *   Core Summary: Can you give a starting place.

*   A: Grinding 6 Months
    *   Core Summary: take at least about 6 months to do something.

* Q: Do you think there is a specific reason why you were able to come back to coding insted of banking?
    *   Core Summary: Asks the reasons why it was able to comeback to programming instead of banking.

*   A: Laid off => Resurrect the Passion and Finance Skills:
    *   Core Summary: The real cool part isn't finding the bounties is participating in those experiences.

*   A: Stay and Go to something Else and Find Solutions:
    *   Core Summary: He just wanted to make money while working in software , it was a kind of unraveling all these mysteries for him to find the problem solution and to put it to work.

*   A: Look Something, Have the Passion for Security, a Specific Mindset, Look From Outside, Better Fluent:
