## PoP #3 - Maxime Desalle - Interview Summary

**Introduction**

*   **Q:** Please tell us a little bit about who you are and what you do.
*   **A:** I'm Max, I work at clayer, building a token streaming protocol. I'm also a student at the University of Montreal in math and physics.

**Maxime's Dual Life: Work & Studies**

*   **Q:** So you're working there and at the same time, you're doing a degree for mathematics and physics, right?
*   **A:** My hobby is my degree. My typical primarily focuses on operations. Everything that has nothing to do with the technical side.

*   **Q:** How do you manage your time between your work and your University?
*   **A:** One of the advantages with siblier is that it's fully remote. I can work wherever I want, whenever I want, so synchronous is a big advantage. We minimize calls and we really focus on asynchronous text-based conversations. it's much easier to mix with studies. Because it can work whenever I free time in my studies, I can focus directly on stable here get some tasks done.

*   **Q:** That sounds like a very interesting approach. You get business skills and experience and do technical also.
*   **A:** My strategy has always being to go on the technical side while on the work site to go in with everything that hasn't anything to do with the technical side. So once I finish my studies, I will be as multi-disciplinary as possible and just be able to address um all the sides of of the business I would say.

**In-Depth Look at sablier**

*   **Q:** Can you tell us little bit more about subplier and what you actually do for the company?
*   **A:** At sleep later, we build a token streaming protocol. The leading Streaming protocol in crypto and so what they're consuming is basically um if I want to send you a hundred dollars over a month, I can do so using savedlayer and every second of the month you will receive a fraction of those hundred dollars. Streaming a song on Netflix on Spotify or a movie on Netflix except here it's with money. We are really shifting the way payments work by synchronizing them with time essentially. Every second you receive a fraction of those total payments. I focus mostly on you know everything that has to do with marketing sales customer support organizing events creating contents also some strategy too, also some you know coding tasks, but mostly it's it's really not technical.

*   **Q:** How would you end up of getting this role?
*   **A:** I worked previously at Hi-Fi so I was hired when I was 17. We' were building a fixed rate lending protocol and I started working on the community aspect and evolved mostly on working in marketing and that kind of stuff. Hi-Fi had initially acquired sabler back in the day and so I worked with Paul who is now the CEO at cedler on a regular basis at Hi-Fi, and then eventually siblier got so successful. We reached I think over a billion dollars in in TVL back in 2021 because without any marketing we did nothing, we just laid it there because the whole team was focused all the Hi-Fi Lenny portal. Paul started to think oh maybe we should spin this and

**Advice for newcomers and future and quantum computing**

*   **Q:** What's your advice for people that are still in high school or just starting university, and you're looking to get into space?
*   **A:** You don't need any degrees or anything. I mean people usually say that for startups but in crypto they really don't care.I would just join a ton of discords, become active but be careful and I think if you're trustworthy in the space, that's all that matters. It's hard ironically in crypto uh where we are building Tristram systems If you have integrity if you're a professional I think you can get a long win in crypto.

*   **Q:** Any thoughts about Quantum computing?
*   **A:** There is hype in the media, you don't need any degrees. One of the beautiful things about crypto is that we have a real product market fits, it is still very young, need players to do something that is actually important, useful for people in companies

**Book Recommendations**

*   David Deutsch The Beginning of Infinity very optimistic worldview.

 * **Q:** and the anthropic principle from Red Hall.
*   **A:** The beginning of infinity and which really shaped my worldview basically if you ever think that through through this lens and and I think it's just an incredible book where are pretty much against calls in general to text based conversations because work much better and.yeah the beginning of The One Thing is they’ve never given yield or farming.

**Governance**

*   What are your thoughts

*  it can't be an actual use case you could be hired to a DAO as an anonymous you won’t even to call to be much more convenient and keep the commute

*   What is actually important actually get this role so I work hi fi to build that I think there is one of the protocols have

In General

*  "Trust": One’s word worth weight over marketing. It takes you further

*  A degree is good but isn’t needed in Crypto

*   Read “The Beginning of Infinity” by David

*  Ask a simple question- “Does my token have Purpose?”

 * If not go out there.

 * The system comes from is going to prevent crime altogether, I mean not all altogether, obviously, but so it's.so I'd say for mostly so I think save there is one of the few protocols has direct
