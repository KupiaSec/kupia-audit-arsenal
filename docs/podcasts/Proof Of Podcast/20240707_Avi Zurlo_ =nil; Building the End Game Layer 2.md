Okay, here is a markdown-formatted summary of the YouTube video "Avi Zurlo: =nil; Building the End Game Layer 2"

### Introduction
Q: Introduction of Avi Zurlo
A: Avi Zurlo is now deeply involved in the world of zero knowledge proof systems, particularly at =nil; Foundation.

### Avi's Journey to =nil; Foundation

Q: How did you transition from Delphi to =nil; Foundation? Was it something you actively sought, or did the opportunity arise unexpectedly?
A: Misha, the co-founder of =nil;, pitched Avi the idea. Initially, Avi didn't fully grasp it, but it was clear that interesting tech was being built.

Q: Can you clarify what Misha was initially conveying in blockchain terms?
A: Misha was demonstrating application of blockchain in traditional and distribute systems terminology.

Q: So, as time progressed, what aspects of =nil;'s work did you grow to appreciate?
A: The foundation's ZK toolchain and its use of ZK lovm was particularly intriguing.

###  =nil; Foundation: Tools and Products

Q: What does =nil; Foundation bring to the blockchain landscape?
A:  They provide tools for ZK developers, and focus on scaling blockchains.

Q: Could you elaborate on these tools and how they benefit ZK developers?
A: Their ZK toolchain, a combination of their ZK lovm and a ZK proof market makes it a good tool for ZK application developers.

Q: Can you shed some light on the initial product, the ZK toolchain?
A: The first product was the combination of ZK lovm as a circuit compiler that compiles code to circuit and proof market to outplace proof generation,

### =nil; Foundation: Layer 2 Vision

Q: Can you share more detail about this Layer 2 solution?
A: Horizontally scalable Ethereum L2. Uses ZK sharding.

Q: The Need for ZK Sharding
A: Scalability is the motivation. Intends solve biggest L1 problems with the most cutting-edge technology.

Q: Why did you choose to create another L2 solution?
A: They wanted to solve the biggest problem space iun the space, but the cutting state-of-the-art tech.

Q: How does nil's L2 vision differ from those already existing
A: Instead of scaling simply "EVM", they have horizontal scalability by sharding.

####  Vertical vs. Horizontal Scaling

Q: As such a core level, can you explain how this ZK Toolchain has the potential to transition into day to day responsibilities?
A: When it came the time to make a move, it was a natural process.

Q: Vertical Scaling Explained
A: Scaling blocks by maximizing the power of a single machine. Adding core parts to improve processes,

Q: Describe Horizonal Scaling
A: Blockchains using distributed system terminology. terminology, and vernacular.

Q: Combining The Two
A: A hybrid environment is preferable, there is a relationship between to the technologies being build.

####  The Importance of Understanding Distributed Systems
Q: Understanding this distributed systems will you help you in the long term?
A: Will make our relationship much smoother.

#### =nil; ZK Sharding Business Model
Q: What has been your business model that contributes to third parties?
A: It is contract based work.

#### Blockchain Infrastructure Development
Q: What role does infrastructure play in blockchain developement?
A: Is mostly third party

#### The L2 Layer Structure of Consensuss Prtoof
Q: I know this has something to do with L2. What role has your protocol played in that?
A: I wanted to move into Layer two, focusing more on blockchain scalability infrastructure .

#### Key differences and benifits.
Q: With scaling so abundant, what was the big challenge about it?
A: To be able to solve space through Elite technology development. 

Q: Layer Two vs. Rollup in a Simple Analogy
A: Layer two can achieve more that roll ups, so I think this layer is what we should put money onto.
