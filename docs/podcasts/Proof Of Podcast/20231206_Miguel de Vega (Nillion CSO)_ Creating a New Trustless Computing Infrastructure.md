## Summary of "Miguel de Vega (Nillion CSO): Creating a New Trustless Computing Infrastructure"

**Introduction and Background**

Q: Can you give us a little bit of an introduction of who you are, your background?
A: Miguel de Vega introduces himself. His background is at the intersection of technology and math. His formal education was in Telecom Engineering, completed by a PhD in mathematics. Then he worked at Siemens in Germany, solving advanced mathematical problems required by every business unit.

Q: So what drove you to crypto and now you are a founder of Nillion? So what happened in the meantime from getting really interested into crypto to uh, starting your own project in the space yeah.
A: Miguel met Andrew Masanto in 2017 and they explored applying cryptography to problems in Web3, with Alex Page (Nilon CEO) and Andrew Yio (CMO). This led to brainstorming how a certain piece of math could turn into technology, eventually forming the vision for Nillion: a decentralized platform for secure storage and computation of sensitive information.

**What is Nillion? What is MPC?**

Q: Start by kind of giving a preface of what is NPC [sic], MPC...
A:  MPC stands for Multiparty Computation. It is any computation where there are many parties, usually controlled by different companies that collaborate to jointly compute a program/function while *not* sharing the *inputs*. In this set up theyÂ´re able to maintain the privacy of their inputs and come up with the result from that computation, but wihout running it on a single computer.

**What is special about Nillion? A different Architecture?**

Q: Let's talk about the weights of those differences. Can we get a brief overview or high level review of what it is, uh, what Nillion is and from like a practical stand point.
A:  Nillion is web3 infrastructure, meaning it isn't run by a single entity, however nodes runs by different entities where governance is by a Swiss Association (controlled by token holders). What sets it apart is being for General compute and storage. By addressing computing stuff without sharing information.

**How to Understand the Need for Nillion's Solution?**

Q: [...]What drove the creation in the first place?
A: Nillion tackles the "unwritten rule of the internet," which states that every time you interact with an internet service provider, you have to give them part of yourself.  This piece of your personal identity and data is then irreversibly transferred, losing control of that information.  Nillion aims to change that paradigm.

Q: But there's others uh there's other UM pets or or Ps um privacy enhancing Technologies that are very interesting indeed um you have fully homemorphic encryption, you have differential privacy you have multi-party computation so that takes us to this MPC UM acronym what it means.
A: Existing privacy-enhancing technologies like FH and differential privacy operate on a client-server model.  Nillion, on the other hand, utilizes a network-based architecture more akin to decentralized web3 systems. This makes removing trust possible by means this novel technology.

**Benefits and Use Cases of Utilizing Nillion**

Q: So with that being said, you combine it with web3 which is all about community and collaboration and also trust or trust minimization this could be a perfect match and
  we kind of then set ourselves to um create this public decentralized UM platform for secure storage and compute of of sensitive information whatever you may be you know it can be from people it can be from companies from government so that was a little bit kind of the thought process.
A: Miguel explains further that their design enables collaboration *without* sharing data in a secure way. So the benefits is for:
* **Secure Smart Contract Execution**.
* **Adding Privacy to NFTs**.
* **Private DAO voting**.
* The Internet, which *happens* to be that one thing made *by humans* that is so complex that requires that special type of maths. Fractal geomentry. Which is what Nillion offers.

**Technical Breakthroughs and RoadMap**

Q: So what kind of uh what sort of possibilities can emerge from that, that what are the practical things that can happen having that kind of capabilities on a technological level.
A:
Building effective compilers to bridge the gap between high-level descriptions of problems and low-level representations. It was also important to build technology in what Nillion believes in its core-vission.

Q: And kind of the last question. What's the estimated date where people are going to be able to try to build things onon.
A: They aims an "open" *testnet* during week of the 7th of November (check their Twitter account Andrew.Yo@nillion.com)
