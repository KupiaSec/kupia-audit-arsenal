## Ellie: How Code4rena Went From Dust To Stardom - Summary

This is a summary of an interview with Ellie, Head of Product Ops at Code4rena, detailing her background and the evolution of the platform.

**Part 1: Introduction and Ellie's Background**

*   **Q:** Tell us a little about your background and what you do.
*   **A:** Ellie has a long and varied background in the tech industry as a front-end developer and running her own development shop. She joined Code4rena in May 2021 when it was still relatively early and figuring things out, and is currently the Head of Product Ops.

**Part 2: Joining Code4rena and Early Days**

*   **Q:** How did you first get involved with Code4rena?
*   **A:** She was asked to join by Sock, with whom she had worked on other projects. Despite not knowing much about Web3 or security, Sock believed her skills in event management, community management, business organization, and working with developers would be valuable.

*   **Q:** What was it like in the early days at Code4rena?
*   **A:** The early days were a learning curve. The amount of processes now present had to be implemented.

**Part 3: Code4rena's Evolution**

*   **Q:** In the 2.5 years you've been involved, what's changed at Code4rena?
*   **A:** The number of audits has increased, as well as the community size. Processes have emerged to scale. A key focus is on aligning different incentives with open-source projects (audits and compensation).

    The quality of audits has improved thanks to high quality judges.

**Part 4: The Magic of Fresh Eyes(New Talent)**

*   **A:** There's something special about bringing on a new one of our developers. A lot of our folks have never learned so much about the project as when they onboard the new developer into them. There's something so magical about fresh eyes. Even strong chain links need to come knowing not to underestimate a new face, since they do have incredible insight. A lot of projects don't have the skills for onboarding.

**Part 5: The Educational Aspect and the Role of Product Ops**

*   **A:** Code4rena has an educational component and there's not necessarily an educational code. That's how it was created that got her hooked and kept her around. Now as Lead of Product ops she tries to support and guide the developers of contest admins who run competitions. This also involves supporting sponsors. It was delivering all aspects of what they do.

**Part 6: Balancing Sponsor Needs and Warden Security**

*   **Q:** What unique elements do you think Code4rena brings to the table?
*   **A:** It balances needs to prioritize projects' security with opportunities for freelance security researchers. It provides opportunities for people to run their own business, like invoicing and billing.

**Part 7: Leveling the Web3 Ecosystem Playing Field**
*  **A:** Believes that it's all about leveling up the whole ecosystem by providing people who wouldn't otherwise have the capital with a new opportunity.

**Part 8: Focus On Processes and Impartiality**

*   **A:** Code4rena is heavily focused on open-source. Ellie was excited about that aspect because it levels up the whole ecosystem. Code4rena has built repeatable processes that are fair and prioritize the security of projects, while attempting to provide opportunities for wardens.
    The people in chain are all seasoned with years of experience, because they have previously built successful businesses.

**Part 9: Code4rena's Growth and Community Insights**

*   **A:** Ellie and Jay reminisced about the old days (early 2021), when they would launch one audit per week. Now running many more all at a time. She sees a greater variety of offerings now.
*   They are working to build new processes. Processes are thoroughly and correctly made throughout by a team.

*   **A:** The og team of wardens have been building with us in C4. Contributed massively.

**Part 10: The Numbers and Current Project Focuses**

*   **A:** There are over 5,000 registered wardens in code4rena now. Not all have competed necessarily. Code4rena still has data migration issues they're working through, has repeatable processes that is making projects secure without too much manual effort.


**Part 11: Addressing AI and Code Generation**

*   A lot of platforms have unintended consequences on display. You think they are doing X when they are actually doing Y, Zed, and ABC.

*   **Q:** What about the rise of Al and Code generation?
*   **A:** Ellie thinks about Kevin Kelly saying you can either resist change or try to work with it.

**Part 12: Bot Races to Enforce Rules**

*   **A:** Some Wardens are using GTP to clean up grammar to try to make repos more legible: "we need to level the ecosystem playing field and that there's a need for new educational content

*   **A:** C4 is having its first Cod Arina Supreme session where senior judges go in to review audit issues of the bot races and code.

**Part 13: Advice for Wardens**

*   The #1 tip is read old reports and look at what analysts were doing then and more recent, and how did those people perceive the project. The best to learn code is to teach code. There are tons of great people posting in the shared educational channel, that I would encourage beginners to check out and learn!
*   The quantity has for sure increased a lot. 5,000 registered wardens. Number of different offerings/competitions available. The community has grown exponentially.

**Part 14: Code C4rena's Future**
*   At the end of that, there's some excitement with all of those new C4 additions!
