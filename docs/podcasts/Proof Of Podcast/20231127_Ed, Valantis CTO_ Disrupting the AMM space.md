Okay, here's a summary of the YouTube video titled "Ed, Valantis CTO: Disrupting the AMM space", following the interview flow:

**Introduction**

*   Q: Please introduce yourself.
*   A: Ed, based in London, building the Valantis protocol.

**Background and Education**

*   Q: Tell us about your background.
*   A: Started with undergrad in physics, then got interested in machine learning/AI. Did some undergrad programming, then postgrad in machine learning. Worked in AI and started a startup.

**Early Career and Crypto Discovery**
* Q: What made you switch from machine learning to crypto?
* A: Was in the middle of PhD. and was surrounded by software engineers. Merging computers and data to making prediction was interesting. AI felt stressful as results weren't always as sure as Software engineering where you could get from A to B.
Decided build a startup with a friend which was AI based.

**Diving into DeFi**

*   Q: How did you get into crypto?
*   A: Got into crypto by accident in 2021, prompted by news and a lack of local knowledge of Ethereum, private keys, and blockchain. Read a book, started learning the terms around crypto and wanted to experience using the system.

**First Experiences with AMMs**

*   Q: What interested you then?
*   A: Purchased some ETH, and then quickly started trying out Uniswap. Became expensive to operate directly in ETH, so started experimenting within Polygon to interact with various decentralized applications

* Q: What were your thoughts as you starting using the apps?
* A:  Felt like a casino. Tokens had "rug pulls" and so he lost a small amount amount playing around. Saw high frequency traders were making profit in the pools and was curious how they were doing it
* Q: Realized AI or software engineering background more helpful?
* A: From AI side, didn't feel empowered as all the compute was expensive, and it was pivoting to game engine programming, getting in Unity. Got bullish in 2021 in crypto

**Transition to Becoming Technical in DeFi**

*   Q: When did you start being technical in DeFi?
*   A: Couldn't stop thinking about DeFi, and realized I wanted to code smart contracts. Learned Solidity, reverse engineered code to understand how to work protocols, so could start programming M-pool. Learned painful lesson that simulations don't work very well on mainnet as there are attacks, tokens etc.

**Joining Gelato and Next Steps**

*   Q: How was your experience then?
*   A: Pivoted then doing game editor programming and working about Unity. That's when got really into like software engineering. That got my in to Crytpo accidently
Joined Gelato network as a core developer with part time job, to try finish of the PhD . Saw lots of protocol had smart contracts to test

**Overview of Valantis Protocol**

*   Q: How did you go from working like that, to building Valantis protocol?
*   A: "I couldn't stop thinking about defi"

*Q: Whats the difference between existing dex models/ what makes your approach fresh?
*A: existing Dex models do no allow the developer for great level customization and flexibility. Instead, Valtanis is designing a model is that is:
reusable, and contains multiple modular structures at the same

**The Modular Approach of Valantis**
The major module is AMM core ( contains swap function), has an additional option of decentralized oracles, a verifier module.
A: Want it to be "plug and play", easy to use for the user and highly scalable to meet different demand (such as rebased tokens

**The Long Term Vision**
Has this view always been part of the strategy, or more recently, that’s something that the team are heading to now?

*   Q: Is that right?
*   A: That was moment dropped what was doing because what I knew was "mind blowing, which combined AI and code completion". There wasn't much time as have a deadline. However at the end there's two areas: Reusability and having power to hit target.
    With AI didn't feel that empowered that the Al could hit the target

He did describe these as key goals from the start point – and that is something their strategy has been very aligned around from the start, with their framework being set up to provide it.

**Addressing Liquidity Fragmentation**

*   Q: Now, with this sovereign, all the power at the designer, all have liquidity there, wont it become very limited or too fragmented? (There can be separate issues of liquidity fragmentation around different levels that result).
*   A: We are addressing here, where there not separate entities. It allow people to interact permissionlessly from that.

**Further Exploration and Community**

*   Q: So that pretty much wraps this up for that, I just want to ask whether is there any other ways people get involved with Valantis.
*   A: A lot, but they will be revealed over the next weeks

**Final Thoughts**

*   A: The projects takes unique angle
