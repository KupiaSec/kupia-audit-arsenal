*   **Q:** Can you introduce yourself, your background, and Sablier?
*   **A:** Paul R. Berg is the co-founder and CEO of Sablier Labs, building a money streaming protocol on Ethereum. The focus is on token investing which works by making a one-time deposit; tokens are streamed every second. He has been involved in crypto for five years.

**Part 2: Paul's background (0:21 - 1:42)**

*   **Q:** Where did you and How did you become a developer?

**Part 3: Motivations and Savior (1:42 - 3:21)**

*   **Q:** your motivations for starting seven year
*   **A:** He watched a presentation from Andreas Antonopoulos on money streaming on the Lightning Network and realized that what was being built on Bitcoin could be done on Ethereum with Savier. It's solving our situation on ethereum there were places going with 2018 2019.

**Part 4: How Savior Works (3:21 - 4:21)**

*   **Q:** Talk about Savior is and what implications has.
*   **A:** Savior pioneered "lockup streaming." Senders deposit tokens into a contract, and every second, a small amount is streamed to the recipient. The recipient receives a payment link to track earnings and make withdrawals. Streams cannot be canceled.

*  **A:** Savior V2 introduced NFTs - every stream is an ERC-721 NFT, integratable with DeFi. And What they Called a Lookup Dynamic allows non-linear Streaming: this kind of Incentive Structures like for example you set up an exponentially Stream:
*  **Q:** In Exponentially More Tokens ,how do Non-linear Streaming Incentives can influence.
*  **A:** Non-linear incentives prioritize teamCollaboration (like long-term). One implementation is a long-term contract between employee. The way it works for employee has to Stay will have more tokens. Dynamic opens a new design Space new incentive. schemes , that can incentivize to be done on chain.

    -NFTs allow you to put your savings into a lending protocol and borrow capital with the underlying stream acting as collateral is actually controls solving our Situation tokens tokens, which can be used, can be collateral but not just like future Earnings:

**Part 7 How Paul Berg think about building and how it relates to quantum models (8:59 - 98,42)**

*   **a** to get code a robust, what is, the approach to it from the gound up
*  We need is called a discrite payment biased .When you think the word payment it's like a one time Event there.

    *That, to the
discrep payment, so we think that block changes,
*What about  other that are all of that by high high

I was getting paid in fiat like I think to 80 on
that, natural to see what is that six months later I dropped
