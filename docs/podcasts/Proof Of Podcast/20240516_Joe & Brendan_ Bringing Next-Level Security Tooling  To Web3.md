## Joe & Brendan: Bringing Next-Level Security Tooling To Web3 - Summary

This summary captures the core discussion between the interviewer and Joe and Brendan from Audit Wizard, focusing on their approach to Web3 security tooling, the challenges they're addressing, and their vision for the future.

**Part 1: Introduction and Motivation**

*   **Q:** Why did you guys decide to go in this direction of building security tooling for Web3?
*   **A:** The idea was born out of the friction while doing auditing. Web2 had certain structure but tooling in Web3 was lacking. Web3 doesn't have a lot of structure to it and the tooling wasn't as well-developed. The goal is to solve problems related to auditing.

**Part 2: Audit Wizard's Approach & User Perspective**

*   **Q:** What's the core philosophy behind Audit Wizard, and what problems are you trying to solve for auditors and developers?
*   **A:** From auditor background the core is I was using developer tools to do security engineering work and that always felt a little bit clunky. Need tools to understand code I need tools that give me insights I need to be able to run scanning tools really easily. What do you need that could run some tests and things like that is something you plan to implement.

**Part 3: Core Features and Future Vision**

*   **Q:** Is that something you plan to implement in Audit Wizard, like running testing suits for the projects or fuzz integrated, something like this?
*   **A:** The vision is to make Audit Wizard this singular place for you to do everything you need. Testing stays really important. One thing we're working on that we think is taking a step back and looking at auditing as a whole identifying where do you what's the most impactful thing to do.

**Part 4: Code Editing and AI Integration**

*   **Q:** Are there tools that you want them to be able to use in order to even add it to the code maybe is that's something that you guys also think is going to be able to implemented or something you guys already have in mind?
*   **A:** We're going to adding the ability to edit the code, to write template tests. You can run tests but you can create templates. You think the way we described the one the possibilities on how to edit a code is definitely something that. That we're also planning.

**Part 5: Business Model and Future Plans**

*   **Q:** What is the plan for the tool to remain like open source to everyone for everyone or do you guys intend to implement some type of charging at some point?
*   **A:** Auto Wizard everything's been free. Pro Plan with more core features.
    Have the ability to run tests and a little notepad where can create them and help there's always something more to do just one-stop shop, the only thing you have is auto work yeah.

**Part 6: Differentiation from Other security Tools & Long-Term Vision**

*   **Q:** So it do you run formal interviews or is it just kind of like a brainstorming exercise and maybe picking someone's brains every now and then?And how are you different from other security tools?
*   **A:** All operate on and zooming out in the long term Vision is make audience wizard on the thing you have open the that's what they're to all, they made me in the best but the AI the lack of lack of lack to do yeah and the need a testing.

**Part 7: AI Strategy**

* **Q:** What it I are you guys using for the is it just using chat GPT or are you guys using some other some of other models?
* **A:** It's just GPT all llm based why can AI features contained in the land stuff it easy that help is.

**Part 8: Threat Modeling and Web 3 Security Differences**
* Q: Do you have like a a mind map of priorities or just different areas that this software needs to like the main areas that you guys focus when you're developing and thinking about new features? Is there a roadmap?
* A:  This was all about high priorities in security in with but you take those.
**Part 9: Implementation and Future Expansion**

* Q: You have this implemented in the code or something you guys already have in mind?
* A: Have edit the code something run what about to is really for is to.
