# Spadaboom: Lessons From Building BadgerDAO - Summary

This is a summarized version of the Youtube video in a Q&A format.

## Introduction

The video intro includes thanking sponsors for making the podcast possible. (Savaure)

## Motivations Behind Founding BadgerDAO

Q: What got you into founding BadgerDAO?
A: Motivated by experiences with CI-oriented businesses in 2018-2019 as promises and black boxes around depositing crypto and earning yield didn't work out in his favor. It made him wonder why there is non-custodial transperency.

A: Another motivation was the lack of attention on bringing utility to Bitcoin within the DeFi space powered by Ethereum smart contracts.

## The Vision and Ecosystem of BadgerDAO

Q: About merging Ethereum with Bitcon and the idea behind it.
A: The aim is an ecosystem powering a whole slew of different protocols that bring those two assets and networks together.

A: A bitcoin bridge to bring bitcoin to etherum and vice versa. There was yield strategies, synthetic bitcoin, etc. This was chapter one that used ethereum network.

A: This helps to allow a more trustless representation of Bitcoin to grow and expand via Etherum, vs trying to squeeze bitcoin into a Defi environment.

## Evolving Governance and Security in BadgerDAO

Q: About vision for governance in BadgerDAO
A: Inspire community driven organizations on-chain. Experiment for everyone instead of it being controlled.

A: But, there many ups and downs with the unorganized chaos in this experiment. As a non-organized organization may look. How vision has changed in 3 years, etc. Clear it needs to be more safe
Q: What innovations do you think this can Foster for the whole ecosystem

A: Building eBTC as smart contract based Bitcoin on the Etherium network which is completely mutable for anyone can hold, transfer, mint & burn. A CDP to collateralize assets, borrowing and opening up loops. The interest is then used to create a yield enivironment to incentiviate people to leverage token

## The Importance of Security and Transparency in Smart Contracts

A: They think there has to be a more trustless representation of Bitcoin on-chain

A: There is little demand to bring Bitcoin from ethereum. There was a lot of security in making sure that can remain decentralized in their ethos.

### Key security concepts:
* Contract only.
* Transparency.
* Self-custody by users.
* Trustless solutions

A: People can just verify

## How to Secure a Protocol

A: Ebtc has immutable smart contract that can't be changed and also not touching other user funds.

A: First, have a very competent security-minded
    â€¢Have internal testor or third party tester
There has to be process and checks which should all be public.
That enables progress and eliminates. Some of the pain and asymmetries are key

### What key items should it have
*   Zero fees
*   Audit

The auditor should be separate from the original group - to be able to find out information and come and review!

A: With those steps, is can get up to 12 or 13 step. And that is battle tested
## Building a Strong Team and Community
A: I get contacted now by many people how sorry they were for what happen and it is all in how it get integrated now.

Here you are talking about how the people who work in the organization should look out on the project
*   There has to be High Integrity
*   Long term relationships

You have then has to be able to see other people's perspective

A: There are steps they can take to keep up all that, one part is to find out individuals within. the area! There's all that unchaining there! Has to be many diverse people with many different aspects of different security

## Market Conditions and Their Influence on Development

A: There is trial and error.
There has been time, and change seeing how it goes. One of the biggest lesson is you start slow and over time is becomes worth it to everyone

Also about the ups and Downs there are and if it's related to market conditions.
It was hard from all the unorganized chaos.
Market often does many odd thing!

Q: So those that have high success have to follow other rules than normal business?

A: It takes a lot of work dedication and long term alignment.

The biggest lesson you learn what does not kill you makes you stronger
Start slower to decentralize it
But have it still make sense!

It was not about all the money or the market success !

It needs to come down to real code

It only the matter what you use for code to run things!

## Conclusion

Building with value that allows people great impact. It's all about long term visions
