## Summary of "Pop #2 - 100proof | How He Uncovered a $100M Exploit in KyberSwap"

This is a summary of an interview with 100proof, a smart contract auditor, about his experiences and how he found a significant exploit in KyberSwap.

*Interviewer asks 100proof to introduce himself.*

**Q:** Can you tell us about yourself and your background and how you got into auditing?
**A:** 100proof has been a software developer for approximately 18 years and has had an interest in cryptocurrency and blockchain since he was 16.

**Part 2: Early Days in Auditing and The Start Of Auditing (11:50 - 26:20)**
*Getting into Code4rena*

**Q:** How was doing auditing in the beginning?

**Part 4: The KyberSwap Exploit - Initial Feelings and Investigation (40:40 - 52:40)**
*Looking at liquidity projects*

**Q:** How Did you feel during the different stages of the Khyber hack process and why did you look at it in the first place?
**A:** He had some previous expertise in concentrated liquidity projects from earlier audits. He had found a bug in sushi swap and decided to look for other concentrated liquidity projects.

**Part 5: UniSwap, SushiSwap, & Rememberance (52:40 - 59:50)**
*Realizing the amount of dollars he found vulnerability for*

**Q:** Did you have a bug to start from one of the judges in a C4 contest?
**A:** 100proof came across Christophe Michelle's blog post and was impressed. There was solid project analysis in the audit competition for sushi swap trident. Having a lot of the skills necessary for the job although not realize them at first.

**Part 6: TVL & "Proof Of Concept" (59:50 - 81:10)**
*Knowing the numbers behind the project's contracts*

**Q:** Before discovering what vulnerability you were going to look at in kyber hack where did your head go first to check?
**A:** 100proof checks the Total Value Locked (TVL) in the project to estimate the risk and if it is worthwhile to pursue, until one day he randomly remembered a conversation about KyberSwap.

**Part 7: Concentrated Liquidity (81:10 - 90:05)**
*100proof explains concentrated liquidity further*

**Q:** Can you try to fast-forward to now, you're doing those kinds of things and it's just really cool to see that it would actually came to that realization?
**A:** He remembered the conversation while looking at the codeArena audit competition for SushiSwap Trident. He said the depth of his understanding was so impressive, he reached out to say, wow, that's really impressive how the hell do you find things and that's how he remembered KyberSwap.

**Part 8: Diving Deeper into the Proof of Concept (90:05 - 104:40)**
*A more in-depth explanation and proof of concept*
**Q:** So when you were going through your Khyber hack, how did you feel during the different stages of process, and how are you feeling and why you did decide to have a look at it in the first place?
**A:** Because he gained some expertise in concentrated liquidity projects, meaning he understood them. He then found a bug in sushi swap.

**Part 9: The Process (104:40 - 122:10)**
*Going through the process until his final moment of discovery*

**Q:** Alright, I'm going to cut you off here

*Breaking concepts down so people can better understand.*

**Q:** Could you perhaps give our audience - the non-technical folks- a bit of a very short analogy to describe auditing the bug that you found?
**A:** Well, With all of these concentrated liquidity projects, it's the boundary value. Fortune favors those prepared. As a smart contract auditor you need to be very excited when those things come to realization.

**Part 11: The Art of Hacking Back Into His Own Wallet (135:70 - 140:70)**
*Finding problems when it comes to concentrated liquidity and it's overall set up.*

**Q:** We fast forward to now, you're doing more or less code base and you just hoped that if I and did find some thing that they would be ament.
**A:** Well based off of past experience an inkling of something could go wrong

**Part 12: The Final Stretch (140:70 - 158:80)**
*Working on the proof of concept*

**Q:** So you look at the codebase or proof of the 8k did you take take you have to dig in and to the point that that you really your doing it?
**A:** To put it shortly, and great. Even though I spent some time a few days working on the project they still took a few times because a few days is a few times.
