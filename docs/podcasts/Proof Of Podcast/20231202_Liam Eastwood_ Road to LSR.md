# Liam Eastwood: Road to LSR - Interview Summary

This is a summary of the YouTube video interview titled "Liam Eastwood: Road to LSR".

## Introduction

**Q:** Can you please introduce yourself?

*Core Summary:* Asking Liam to introduce himself to viewers.

**A:** Liam is a lead security researcher at Spearbit. He's been in the auditing space for about three and a half years. He started his journey at Sigma Prime before transitioning to coding because of Covid. He built a reputation on that platform leading him to independent work.

*Core Summary:* Liam introduces himself, his role at Spearbit, his experience, how he got started in security, and his transition to working independently.

## Journey and Experiences

**Q:** What's it like to work with different contest class platforms.

*Core Summary:* Asks about Liam's experiences working with various platforms.

**A:** It's been a very fun journey, working with smart people from Spearbit. He also works with different contest class platforms. He enjoys seeing what kind of work each one is getting and moves around to fit into his style, finding it easy and productive to work with talented individuals.

*Core Summary:* Liam describes it as a fun journey, learning from smart people, and being able to work with different platforms to match his working style. He enjoys working with talented people, and sees no downside.

## Auditing Process and Evolution

**Q:** How did your auditing process change compared to when you were looking at contests?
**Q:** How is your auditing process different from Spearbit?. How evolved that?
**Q:** When you started doing contests, what did clients look for?

*Core Summary:* Exploring the evolution of Liam's auditing process and perspective.

**A:** When he started in contests, he began with lower-hanging fruit, focusing on gas optimization and informational issues, which were more lucrative back then.  Now it is more common to file a QA report. The feedback loop in contests was super short with multiple audits per week, providing him with immediate feedback that sped up his journey, now a little bit more selective with QA and more about holistic with more weight on gas optimization, and informationals .
Moving to Spearbit, he's now more thorough at the start of the process, finding real issues.
He was "too lazy" to focus on minor low-level bugs in contests, focusing on medium and high severity issues due to shorter feedback cycle. Now he's teaming up with other Auditors.

*Core Summary:* His approach evolved to focus on high-impact vulnerabilities, becoming more lucrative. He actively avoids tedious work likes reports by focusing on better practices and methods. Then moving to SpearBit, now more thorough at the start of the process, finding high-severity issues. The difference is he is working with teams.

## Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Landscape
**Q:** Tell me more about Zero Knowledge and Tweeting about Cairo.
Is There anywhere we are heading with this landscape

*Core Summary:* Asks Liam to elaborate on his interest in ZK and the Cairo programming language.

**A:** Still new to landscape. The Alphas in this niche, are looking for products that have Critical Payout from 100k or 1 million ( to really fight complex ones because the payout).
He did Anchor protocol for goodness, thing that went wrong.  He's not bothered with Immunefi for the time being. Considers it super competitive, and not sure true that it is, sees new Immunefi project are quickly looked at, it does things is intended to do

*Core Summary:* Interest is more current and no good experience. Describes zero knowledge space as new, fascinating, and overwhelming, focusing in the future on medium and high severity issues. Not equipped to provide guidance yet.

## Diving Deeper into Solidity
**Q:** How you made a shift on getting into Solidity smart contracts

*Core Summary:* Asks about his approach towards working.

**A:** To understand it better. Looking at the fundamentals, so that I can look at different architectures to better understand the various EVM implementation so could have some foundation.

*Core Summary:* Explains the importance of understanding EVM and lowlevel implementation.

## Audits and Collaboration
**Q:** Now that I can guarantee there that's more bugs. Do you approach for doing that?

*Core Summary:* Question relates to auditing more.

**A:** Now it's the way the audits as well, like still finding lots of it. So you have that trust in your integrity.
If you don't find many bugs, to expect that be very, but still bugs just difficult. For approach was pretty chaotic. Honestly more from the creative side keeps me from over methodically. No methodical approach now to be a good auditor. SpearBit always teaming up auditers, have different ways of seeing it different focuses.
There are 1 or 2 people write a lot of gas optimization. My side need not focus on it, I have some really am about it

*Core Summary:*
Audits change your mindset how security firm functions. For holistic reviews and that it is important what is and isn't trusted and communication is key.

## Bug Bounties vs. Security Audits

What are experiences about bug bounties?

*Core Summary:*
Very few Bug bounties and not a lot of time on Immunefi. He did some anchor protocol and had good will and experience.

*Core Summary:*

He just did a lot of Anchor protocol stuff, paid me, good "Goodwill" . Couldn't do it right now .

## Roadmap and Conclusion

**Q:** What are your plans in the future?

*Core Summary:* Asking about his future plans.

**A:** He describes ZK landscape , super fascinating but overwhelming, so focus on areas he is good at to help and increase what security is. And he just wants to do more interesting things.

*Core Summary:* Stating Content what is is and what he is want to accomplish it, and not exactly an intent, so he's just going to enjoy doing the interisting as long he to continue that and do it
