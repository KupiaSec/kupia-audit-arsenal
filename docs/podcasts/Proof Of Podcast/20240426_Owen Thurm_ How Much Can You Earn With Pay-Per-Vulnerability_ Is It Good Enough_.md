## Owen Thurm: How Much Can You Earn With Pay-Per-Vulnerability? Is It Good Enough? - Summary

This is an interview format.

**Introduction (0:00-0:07)**

*   Brief music and introduction.

**Guest Introduction (0:07-0:45)**

*   Q: Please tell us who you are and what do you do?
    *   A: I’m Owen, and did a small solo SAS app with a dozen users before getting into crypto, creating projects like D5 protocol. After a bad audit, got more into the auditing/security space.

**Owen's Background Story (0:45-3:01)**

*   Q: Can you give us the cliff note version and we can talk more?
    *   A: I had a tiny SAS app on the side, but Instagram changed their terms, which wiped us out. Then Bitcoin, then Ethereum with the opportunity to build a D5 protocol. We had a bad audit and rescued funds, and then started auditing.

**About Paper Vulnerability (3:01-4:08)**

*   Q: You were probably the first one to come up with this pay per vulnerability model, or at least do it on a more scalable size. Can you talk about paper vulnerability?
    *   A: The idea grew from the first audit. The cliffs notes are the small fee upfront, and then pay per finding after that.

**The Offer, and Growing The Business (4:08-5:32)**

*   Q: How is it grown, since you talked about adding extra mechanisms to it?
    *   A: Experience led to the offer. It helps new auditing firms to make a better offer. It makes it more likely to win business. It also incentivizes us to uncover these vulnerabilities.

**How Does It Work? (5:32-10:19)**

*   Q: What is the process for this, and also how do you assess severity?
    *   A: First make sure timeline is good, scope the contracts then normalize Solidity code with a script, splitting all money, and setting a cap as needed per code base. Then share database with client real time so fix stuff happens immediately

**Differences Compared With a Traditional Auditing Model (10:19-16:35)**

*   Q: What's different about it?
    *   A: First is risk free and great offer. Gamifying makes incentivizing, so you don't have to make as good of an offer. We've raised the down payment though. Its about high level overview for liners of code, and you get more credibility when you have more experience. Also there is a limit for a certain code base. Great way to get better results though.

**How Projects Reach Out, and Initial Steps (16:35-18:19)**

*   Q: Now how does a project reach out to you about doing this sort of audit? How do you handle it? How do you assess severity?
    *  A: Reach out and figure out timeline, scope contracts, normalize the contracts into sloc count, determine down payment with a formula, then have a set list rate for Critical/High/Med/Low vulnerability to be uncovered.

**The Rates Per Severity of Vulnerabilities (18:19-21:31)**

*   Q: What rates are you currently running with?
    *   A: Current price is: critical $5k, high $250k, medium $1k (for new code base). This is also incentive for you to want to uncover these vulnerabilities.

**Audit Experience, and Database Sharing. (21:31-23:39)**

*   Q: It sounds like it incentivized you to actually want to discover the vulnerabilities, rather than "Okay, I got the money now".
    *   A: Yeah. We also share a database of the findings in real time so the client is able to see and fix.

**Auditing Process (23:39-28:31)**

*   Q: How does the actual engagement/auditing work?
    *   A: It’s audit as normal, the key difference is that we get really excited when we find something. Its sort of incentivized us to actually want to uncover these vulnerabilities. Right is like okay we get the money I now I kind of just want this over with. I mean you get the money upfront only only to fund out their staff to and cover only stuff they found.

**Making "Risk-Free" Offers (28:31-31:10)**

*   Q: So when you decided to to get in, you're like "yeah, let's make a risk-free offer".
    *   A: Yes, which is exactly is what we would want. A small amount up-front, and literally only pay more if we uncover stuff for you.

**How To Get Started in Security Auditing (31:10-35:32)**

*   Q: If you are starting to be a solo auditor or firm, then its fantastic to do. What do you do if you are going to start doing this?
    *   A: It's a better offer, absolutely, because every other firm is going to be it sounds like a fixed flat cost, comparative to your offer. Reserve this spot. This great offer you going to better win business. First, obviously, it was just incentivized us to want to uncover this vulnerabilities. Instead of okay, we need.

**Incentives (35:32-37:57)**

*   Q: I'm almost like, "Well, this also kinda get if I get this overview, it's a great offing.
    *   A: Is incentives. It's gamified with more credibility. After, don't make good offer to win deals.

**Down Payment (37:57-39:49)**

*   Q: In order to get the retainer down payment that it's more like, "I'm split 50/50 so usually about 50% of the money", and everything come from the paying up front, and what do you put into the PPV fees that can be agreed on from ahead of point?
    *   A: About 50% was down payment to reserve the sport from time, code bases can be expensive and I'd want an audit to be where I only pay if I actually get some vulnerabilities uncovered.

**Dealing With Cap Agreements (39:49-40:47)**

*   Q: Then we implement to cap or something can be agreed from ahead a time they cause sometimes code basis just happen to have one he critical vulnerabilities in it that those audits can come out very expensive.
    *   A: Agree. Those audits can come out expensive.

**Projects Reaching Out and Timeline (40:47-42:29)**

*   Q: So how does it work of when a project reaches out to you saying we're interested in this kind of audit and till the report is finalized so how do you do this coping? How do you assess the severity? How do you communicate so this is different in your model than a traditionaling model where is there any the main differences.
    *   A: It's more like advertisement. Reaches out to make sure the timeline right and can actually do work that is a gripe have about the service in general is really hard to schedule and get everything's so we figure that's the timeline's right if is something that you know we think we'd be good fit for that then yeah

**Scope Of The Contracts (42:29-43:38)**

*   Q: In terms of scope, how do you do the auditing and what's the protocol?
    *   A: Have script run and normalize Solidity code and spit out the number of sources count, length of code and how many lines of code that actually going to be in. Because that we determine what the down payment is.

**Set Rates In Agreements (43:38-45:58)**

*   Q: And that we just have like or formulas are very used to that compute that, basically?
    *   A: Yes, set a rate and a formula is $5,000 per critical I 2400 for hi $4,000 for medium what we work our way up to over the last two years for any code base that hasn't been previously reviewed it went through something that reviewing it then we is double that price

**Changing Mindset (45:58-48:01)**

*   Q: To change this way, this just a ton of money in from what it needs in the industry is thinking that's been an audit, nothing comeback, back good.
    *   A: That's case. That, not the that not the case, and what we ended up the have to we ended up having to pay, like, we paid up for what, right and what we paid, you know

**Incentivized Want (48:01-49:34)**

*   Q: A decent amount, it wasn't there a top tier firm or anything like that you didn't raise any money for this anything like that I wanna that's what inzed like you said you're still there for actually uncover this vulnerabilities.
    *   A: To ton money up and have literally nothing covered on, do they only find out I have what stuff uncover are all right well I wasn't an it where and audit I only pay vulnerabilities are uncovered.

**Team Effort (49:34-54:28)**

*   Q: So where is one of the friendentials that you doing auding that I think you probably were the first on to come up this model or the only wanted to doing it on a more scalable size is paper vulnerability?
    *   A: One of the diffentials.

**Benefits (54:28-57:29)**

*   Q: Are the benefits that you doing auding I paper vulnerability model yeah and that you were doing it something that like to see?
    *  A: You great listen it great like if, starting out even auditor or starting your own firm fantastic way just to make a better offer than all the other firms right and because every other firm is going to fixed comp to your offer is basically this small amount just to

**Is The Trade Off Good Enough (57:29-9:47)**

*  Q: That's not the case that's certainly that's not I have no idea.
    *   A: Get that right, make a risk-free offer we think what I would wanted is offer if know just give small amount of and only. Literally only pay the more uncovered are the first of all is great are gonna to be more likely when business that way but then second obviously it was that what that the industry if the what's if
