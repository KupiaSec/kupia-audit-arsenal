# Jackson: Investing Like a Pro - YouTube Video Summary

This is a summary of a YouTube interview titled "Jackson: Investing Like a Pro," broken down by topic based on the interview flow.

## Part 1: Early Career and Exposure to Crypto

**Q:** How did you get into crypto?

*Summary:*
    *   Started with exposure from a friend who was talking about Ethereum.
    *   At first, didn't understand cryptocurrencies or tokens.

**A:** Briefly touched upon solidity, then security aspect caught traction and later started a web3 contest.

*Summary:*
    *   Over time, learned about smart contracts and found the concept "cool" (in respect that you can program money).

## Part 2: Transition from Machine Learning to Web3 Security

**Q:** You got a degree in music but did machine learning instead, how was that like

*Summary:*
    *   Initially did ML at Amazon, same realization on the applicability
    *   Sees that ML is relatively easy software.

**A:** A ton of Frameworks of Big Data takes care of the complexity, all he does is framework and moves data from unstructured to structured format.

*Summary:*
    *   ML involves translating customer needs into automations, which isn't super sexy.
    *   ML comes with a lot of red tape (regulation) and requires a PhD to do properly.

## Part 3: Smart Contract Audit and Web2 Vs Web3 Ethos
**Q:** So you went from Machine Learning to Web 3 due to not finding it cool and sexy enough

*Summary:*
    *   ML had constraints in terms of getting the right data.

**A:** In web3 Anyone can deploy anything any time, therefore entry barrier is small.
*Summary:*
    *   Smart Contract Code Security is a big deal in Web3.
    *   You deploy programs, and that program is money.
    *   Barriers to entry in Web3 are lower than in AI/ML.

**Q:** Tell us more about that point and your thoughts.
*Summary:*
   * To work for a company, you must always go through the leet code thing, but in web3, its free.
   * In Web3 is everyone is encouraged to just try and do their thing, hence perfectly tailored for him.

## Part 4: Differences Between Web2 and Web3 Hiring Practices

**Q:** So it becomes like a weird experience, program money and then send it out there and if someone uses it anyone can use it - and sign to this is so real?

*Summary:*
    *   Yes, as a "no experience, no network guy" it was perfect due to needing no red tape and in security, no one needed your name.

**A:** Yeah alot of people end up getting into crypo for that reason, which has its downfalls.

*Summary:*
    *   Traditional companies put much focus into those who are grinding leetcode.
    *   Traditional Model has everyone regurgitating the whole industrial eductational model, and feels they are counter-intuitive because you know they understand but actually are not necessary.

**Q:** Elaborate
*Summary:*
    * In big Tech has a weed out process to filter out many applicants that aren't exactly ideal.
	* People in charge comes from the traditional educations model


**A:** Has had co workers that had to go to "Facebook -> Amazon" path, which doesn't solve anything.

*Summary:*
    *  They'd leave fang to leave Amazon, or fb or Google, just isn't what someone's life is supposed to be.

## Part 5; The Art Investment, Due Diligence and Trading style
**Q:** What is your take on the investing side given the security and auditing lens

*Summary:*
    *   As an auditor, got to see many projects early and wanted to invest in them and look at solidity and security.

**A:** It's different being the actual doing the work rather than outside looking in, is fairly easy by following a good library by other people.
*Summary:*
    *   You are really just using the tools built by others (in Machine Learning or Smart Contracts).

**Q:** That makes sense, how has being on the auditing side change your investment philoshiphy

*Summary:*
    *  Investing and finding bugs comes second nature, but not cooler then talking about investing itself.

**A:** More cautious because with Machine Learning you need companies data to train models but with smart contracts you can launch anything with low security barrier.
*Summary:*
    * Needed prior expereince and no network with traditional investing.

**Q:** Got it, tell us, for example on a new project what your procedure is for looking in something.

*Summary:*
	* As the mental model says, solidity its not very complex

**A:** For the most part there is little information and you need the client to sort out the data for you
*Sumamry:*
	* Needs investment to do

**Q:** Got it what is your framework when deciding.
*Summary:*
	* At the end needs mental model usage when programming.

**A:** All that all I did was find, not look the experience network anything yes sing.

*Summary:*
    * In actuality he goes by the sign me up - you know yeah so yeah yeah.

**Q:** That comes up when talking to most people in Crypto.
*Summary:*
   * In crypto people are ending up getting there doing that reason since don't need data.

## Part 6 - Further insights and investing strategies

**Q:** Exactly

*Summary:* That cool I don't have to like not not only that but like even if you were Dev if you wanted to go go at thing.

**A:** You got to do all the leetcode and that's obviously annoys a lot of people as well.

*Summary:*
    * A lot of people in ML has to do all leak code + more when web3 ethos of "just want to work".
    * in essence, if you can do the work then you are going to get paid, with no interviewer.

**Q:** You have no pretense

*Summary:* There's no weird interview thing you're like pretending like regurgitate logarithm you already memorized whatever you know.

**A:** Yeah, I feel like I don't know how that happened, but I feel the big Tech and the Tech industry regurgitated whole industrial educational model and just kind of like

*Summary:* If is machine learn but also very narrowly scope things and something do any control over, whereas smart contracts one can deploy anything at any time barrier entry.

**Q:** Right and because that barrier entry is so low it's low it's just kind of cool like when you deploy your smart, like deploying your first smart contract is always

*Summary:* Its an expereince due normally program money and can deploy something sign up to this and is real thing.

**A:** So comparatively and that regard but yeah money the big difference like for me that had no experience and no network or anything was perfect fit.

*Summary:* He started at Amazon.

## Part 7 - Comparing career in AI and Web3

**Q:** Tell me the big different experiences in career with ai v web3 given u did some of both paths

*Summary:*
    * no experience to data security, didn't need name, had to do find bugs, no matter expereince.

**A:** Yeah, I hear story a lot I would say most people this is how they end up getting into Cryptos for that and, like, oh, cool, I don't have to like

*Summary:*
    *   Yeah I do here story a lot most part how tend to end up getting into crypto's
    *  For the oh dude.

## Part 8 - More on security and its utility

**Q:**  Cool

*Summary:* Don't want not not only have have Dev even wanted go working with thing got gotta do to all leet code that annoying

*A:* Well that's why

*Summary:* Whereas like web3 like the web3 ethos very much more like just go to do work like if you can do the work you're going get paid.

## Part9 - On his booklist and conclusion
**Q:** What book would you put down

*Summary:* What you' best?

**A:* Common profits then

*Summary:* Smart contracts.

## Part 10
*Summary:* The that's all makes to this is why I end up I made this

*Summary:* I kind  the
