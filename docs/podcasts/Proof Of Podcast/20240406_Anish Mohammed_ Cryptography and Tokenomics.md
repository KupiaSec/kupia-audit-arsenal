## Anish Mohammed: Cryptography and Tokenomics - Interview Summary

### Introduction (0:00 - 0:45)
**Q:** Please introduce yourself.
**A:** Anish Mohammed, Co-founder, CTO, and Chief Scientist for Panther Protocol. Has been actively involved in cryptography and crypto research for 20+ years, including being on the cryptography mailing list since the early Bitcoin papers.

### Early Crypto Involvement and Background (0:45 - 2:11)
**Q:** None
**A:**  While present at the initial stages, didn't actively participate until 2011.  Became an advisor to Ripple in 2013, and later was involved with early Ethereum projects like Swarm.  One of the original reviewers of the Ethereum orange paper.

### Protocol Design Experience (1:11 - 1:45)
**Q:** Can you give examples of protocols designed?
**A:** Estimated 20+ protocols designed. Mentioned Ban, Boson, and Pillar.  Worked on several layer-one protocols.

### Academic and Professional Background (2:11 -3:43)
**Q:** You've graduated in cryptography...
**A:** Originally has a degree in medicine. Decided medicine wasn't the path, and transitioned to cryptography. Grew up in India and was exposed to cryptographic concepts through a magazine his father subscribed to and was intrigued by RSA challenges.

### The Shift from General Cryptography to Blockchain (3:43 - 4:46)
**Q:** How was cryptography seen before and after the blockchain hype?
**A:** Prior to blockchain, cryptography was less popular. Blockchain increased the demand for cryptography expertise. Ethereum had no one with PhD cryptography. When ZK came, more mathematicians came in who had actually gone to grad school and also understood cryptography.

### Token Engineering and Protocol Design (4:46 - 5:18)
**Q:** Talk a little bit about the protocols designed.
**A:** Primarily focused on layer-one and second layer design early on.  With Swarm focused on incentive design -- making sure protocols are "free-riding" resistant. More focused on the skeptical side of Crypto.

### Practical Advice for Tokenomics Design (5:18 - 7:05)
**Q:** can you give any advice to founders in designing their tokenomics?
**A:**
1. Organic Utility: A surviving protocol needs organic utility.
2. Aligned Fees: Fees earned must align with protocol's function. Fees earned can not be way higher than the protocol unlocked due to transaction constrains.
3. Understand underlying level characterics: For example. If you don't understand the chain you running on, you will design it incorrectly.

### The Importance of a Pessimistic Mindset & Zero-Knowledge (7:05 - 7:47)

**A:**. Design thinking if nation state is end of game. As a code designer that would be very helpful.

### Book Recommendation (7:47 - 8:34)
**Q:** Do you have any resources you can recomend for people to get a deeper perspective.
**A:** Recommends a book on cryptography, the exact name is to be provided later, about people involved in U-pitopia project where author interviewed real-life people. There are podcasts as well.

### Key Takeaway and final remark (8:34 - end)
**A:** "Do the simple math. We don't even know how much the budget of NSA is, so let's do our own research and math. I do still stand by my earlier advice"
