Okay, here's a comprehensive summary of the YouTube video "Anish Mohammed: No More "Just Trust Me Bro" | ZK Proof Lightbulb Moment" in Markdown format, following the interview flow in parts and using "Q:" and "A:" format:

## Anish Mohammed: No More "Just Trust Me Bro" | ZK Proof Lightbulb Moment - Summary

**Part 1: National Level Threats to Cryptography**

Q: Are there national level threats to cryptography?

A: Yes, governments with significant PhD resources and computational power are always striving to gain an advantage in breaking cryptography, and as a consequence one should't "just trust me bro" anymore; a new approach with Zero Knowledge proofs is a better way.

**Part 2: Historical Context of Cryptographic Weakness**

Q: Can you talk about challenges to cryptographic systems throughout history?

A:  Feedback about flaws in original design of cipher's and encryption techniques and vulnerabilities do inevitably get validated. Sometimes these flaws were present even in algorithms proposed by the best minds at the time. Governments, with their historical data, can ban dangerous concepts; it's a challenge to make new safe techniques, but Zero Knowledge proofs provide better safety,

**Part 3: Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Cryptography (Hotel Analogy)**

Q: Can you explain symmetric and asymmetric cryptography in simpler terms?

A: *Symmetric:*  It's like having a hotel room where everyone has the same key. *Asymmetric:* It's like that the hotel number is on the the public internet but to access your room you need a special key that gives you control in access.
Symmetric crypto uses the same key while in asymmetric cryptography there's separate private and public key pairs from the discrete log problem which can withstand attacks like Shaw's algorithm.

**Part 4: Quantum Computing's Impact and Post-Quantum Cryptography**

Q: What's the impact of quantum computing on cryptography and how are we preparing for Q resistant cryptography?

A: Quantum computers can break current widely used public-key cryptography like integer factorization and elliptical cryptography. Research in lattice-based cryptography and other areas are being made since these problem are thought to withstand quantum computing. Symmetric cryptography requires shorter key sizes for equivalent hardness than public/asymmetric cryptography, but we are looking at new protocols now.

**Part 5: Information Theoretic Security and the One-Time Pad**

Q: Can you explain Information Theoretic Security, and is one solution?

A:  Think of Information Theoretic Security as achieving perfect secrecy.
It is achievable with things like the one-time pad, where the key is the same size as the message, one has theoretical security.

**Part 6: Practical Challenges of Key Distribution & Quantum Key Distribution**

Q: What are the practical challenges with something like the one-time pad, and how do we solve it?

A: QKD is very secure; the main issue is now sharing the one-time-pad. One way is to use Quantum Key Distribution using the BB84 standard: if someone tries to intercept the QKD, there are ways to detect to see that happened and then stop the key distribution process and start again.

**Part 7: Information-Theoretic Security vs. Computational Hardness and Quantum Resistance.**

Q: Recap the types of security discussed?

A: Information-theoretic security provides a theoretical guarantee, but not often implementated; Quantum-resistant cryptography are based on problems currently resistant to quantum computers to prevent any attacks once a practical computer is built.

**Part 8: Current Landscape of Q-Resistance Cryptography and NIST Involvement**

Q: Can we summarize Quantum-Resistant cryptography methods?

A: Yes, coding-theory, napsack problems with optimal constraints to ensure code strength. NIST had a big process to select algorithms; there's a mailing list to discuss. They are building a BCP class to do batch process with it.

**Part 9: The "Bornstein" Algorithm and Homomorphic Encryption**

Q: Is there a new computer with new potential that affect our new Q-resistant crypto?

A: Grovers's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup which might affect symmetric encryption more than asymmetric encryption. Homomorphic encryption may help. 

**Part 10:  The Potential of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**

Q: If we were to recap this interview, what key information would be added?

A:  ZK proofs, by nature, are perfect to implement privacy (proving something without revealing it). This can be used now to validate proofs.
The best attribute is: not depending on trust; so the idea is move to a ZK mindset for maximum safety.

**Part 11: High-Level Overview of Zero-Knowledge Proofs**

Q: How do zero-knowledge proofs generally work?

A: They lets you prove certain statements are true without revealing the information itself in computer science and mathematics.

**Part 12: Challenges without Zero-Knowledge Proofs (Hotel Analogy Revisited)**

Q: Can we compare with our previous talk?

A: Recall our hotel analogy: I want to let you know and actually prove I am in a certain room of a hotel (e.g. I have over 25 y.o.) without revealing the number itself; in a way that other people can validate this statement being true even after I close the doors.

**Part 13: Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Compliance**

Q: How's the situation for the financial use case?

A: ZKPs are great since they could also provide what's known as "Zero Knowledge Compliance" with multi-shore rules.

**Part 14: The "Dark Pool" Analogy**

Q: What is "dark pool" and how do ZKPs improve this?

A:  It's a market where you cannot see how people bought or sell. ZKPs are valuable assets that allows many users to keep control and privacy under all conditions; however, the challenge is to agree about what to consider "legal". In that regard, they create a "shielded" state where one can prove all legal conditions of the state are met.

**Part 15: High-Level Description of Building New Public Key Protocols on Quantum Computing**

Q: What's the future like?

A:  Symmetric key cryptography, coding theory, and other areas are possible, but there is an information-theoretic barrier.
With quantum computers, you can define secure information but not linear combinations that preserve correctness.

**Part 16: Challenges to Widespread Adoption**

Q: How to solve the implementation problems?

A: Two classes of problems exist integer factorization (the "hardness" of doing something based on public key sizes) increases the effort for non-linear polynominal. For example, an increase in size is not linear, it's quadratic in finding finding these values. It will take years... The other cryptography primitives exist by the means of coding theory.

**Part 17: How zero-knowledge will prevent scammers in Defi**

A: It'll be "game changing." With Zero-Knowledge, one can prove their identity and eligibility without having to show trust. There will be a death of scams for those using old methods -- just imagine the possibilities.

**Part 18: Tokenomics and Design Considerations in Panther Protocol**

Q: Why did you decide to go into zero knowledge, and end up in Panther?

A: I find finding patterns useful so that even non-linear humans can create compute, and that's why I'm in it and it reflects my philosophy.

**Part 19: Design for a Sustainable Token Model**

Q: How's the project designed to have a longer value?

A: *Longterm decentralization is important for the protocol's construction -- * Finding cycles in a ring and finding cycles that may affect the process that takes a long time. The bat, charlie ,papa of the right kind and in one sense of peaking . Then finding cycles is a linear field and the key sides to provide some interesting value.
The discrete log problems forms basis of quantum computing. One needs to remember that. 

**Part 20: Real-World Usability and Adoption**

Q: What can we expect from the protocol?

A: 2 areas of use: The problem is with the public chain, also they need information theoretic security. You need to make sure is actually more efficient and scalable, and that needs ZK tech to do the heavy liftings.  And make the chain usable.

Q: More precise for Panther?

A: Yes, there will be real-world usability and there also will be a need for education that goes both ways -- not top down. We're all in this new world together.&#x20;
