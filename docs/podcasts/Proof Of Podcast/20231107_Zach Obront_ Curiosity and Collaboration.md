### Curiosity and Collaboration - Interview Summary:

**Introduction**

Q: Tell us a bit of your journey, how did you get into Security?
A: His entry wasn't intentional, it began with taking a break year, exploring language models and solidity, leading to an immediate connection with the different feel of solidity.

**Career Path & Finding Security Bug**

Q: What did you do since that day you liked solidity?
A: After that year's detour, Obront began freelancing and exploring security aspects by participating in capture the flag (CTF) contests like OpenZeppelin CTF.

Q: Did you have fun doing that?
A: Yes. He spent a week on it every day and figuring out these new things to him and not know any of the security ideas but got deeply into playing and found a real bug in their code and that was real and cool for him.

Q: You found a bug in their code, I can't believe this...
A: He found how, like, the a real developer , could be found a bug in the contest and what are the issues

**Collaboration and learning in contesters**

Q: What happened then? How did they improved?
A: Later he partnered with someone and found the collaboration so helpful and helpful for him. Both saw things differently, helping him calibrate is view and calibration.

Q: What helped this collaboration?
A: Calibrating there, and after this, one month actually and really trying with him all of a sudden, he clicked all right and now I can actually do this.

**Evolution as an Auditor**

Q: How has your auditing approach changed through your journey?
A: At the beginning, it was rushed and not thorough. As it progressed, I built more systems what would happen when working and I need to learn what to learn what am I missing.

Q: So you did any contest I'm doing, think about like, Why did I miss that?
A: And what could I have done and to catch it and what is there like technical knowledge, I, was missing that I should learn. Trying, feel in all those gaps.

Q: so how database had that do is what what the tools you use change at all since that period?
A: The tools changed not much. Because he wants the database for being little more regimented and at some point he realized that the database helped him simplify the auditing. 

Q: What was trigger the thing what was in your mind was you had a job a job they like got ingrained you like I
so what what kind of like triggers?
A: Triggers that comes to the mind now, you know like it did a job, then like this job, you know, the job they do do, you you got ingrained, the what you mean?

 **Tools and Approach**

Q: So you you still not what do you you do you do any diagrams?
A: Primarily, he's taged on vs code because "that is like my what guidance." and remarkable tablets.

Q: Why you do you draw those stuff?
A: Mostly sketching things what make sense to them, their patterns, deep dive places, reviews.

**Formal Verification**

Q: Do the diagrams the diagram is still the same you have you in formal verification those?
A: The formal verification translation functions in pure math translated and if these statements that capture only the state changes, we had that like then it allows myself to move slowly.

Q: Is there an excuse from that test I will sent me the other the show was much for sure.
A: If I sending if, if if I send you an honest good file would be okay if I'm kind of unimpressed, which is good.

Q: All what were some of the properties?
A: Incredibly fun loved and yeah have way too many things I want for non stop Focus on it .

**Collaboration and Learning from Others**

Q: What made it helpful for you working for for work?
A: For a lot of accelerating did and and did little bounty has some are good results with this thing and and then so he started to get me to see.

Q: When he saw his you know was did you say hey then you something was like a medium a severity that you should should be something get it like really help me like
calibrating?
A: calibrate there and after those like month of really trying a month with him all of a sudden, I'm clicked

**The Power of Perspective**

Q: So did you think that's help has always to
you know in a in a really different way.
A: Both saw things things in a a really different way, and also was much better.

Q: Do you you say, like hey this this little thing is saying isn't it a big de actually like look at the situation this this could actually be be like a medium severity thing that you should be submitting.
A: Like really helped me with like calibrating there. "look at the situation is be medium severity you submit them!"

**Advice for aspiring Auditors**

Q: that has your audit approach change much I remember you saying that you had a a question base.
A: went through it the beginning it was like so rushed and thorough and slowly I built more systems is and what's a was like oh need to learn mode anything.

Q: What about you you overall approach that use chains your tools and tools that?
A: feel like it you can like open up a code contest of it It skim and then ignored anything wasn't still.

Q: So, like from this, let's call August.
A: I did a bunch of code and and failed miserably at every single one uh.

Q: Could not quite get it to to work maybe it was July whatever middle last sum?
A: Okay cool. Like time for me to move from to end up in the

**Final Thoughts and Call to Action**

Q: How do I store that stuff to like have like that was you share us and share?
A: Yeah I'll share it with what you think okay cool time for me to move to other.

Q: Does the other projects booked some So like I did I, one contest what what do do the mean I feel like it that's has has all has been been like more?
A: Yeah, then like started to so this was like that was like last summer August I like did a bunch arena contests and failed miserably at every single.

Q: So any of the stuff to move to the next thing is that's where were you really said of a can for.
A: I'm four months into learning solidity I think it's really fun four and have like way many things I want to this and have has just have been that's that's all.

Q: There's thing acceleration which I uh
did little bounty hunting and had some really good results with that and then?
A: I'll be on trying to the best bugs I can and since you started having some success as an auditor has your auditing approach changed much I remember.

Q: Do know I a question based data database based on on the the problems you couldn't solve and then what questions you used to ask yourself?
A: Do you still use that has your overall approach or tools that use change at all since that per Yeah, I feel like.

Q: When say what's an example?
A: I kind of went in beginning, it was like so rushed and not thorough and slowly I kind of like built up more systems in some way that.

Q: If I I, knew was going to be good.
